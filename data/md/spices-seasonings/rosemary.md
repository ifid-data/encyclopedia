**Rosemary**

Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), derived from the Latin "ros marinus" meaning "dew of the sea," is an aromatic evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. While not indigenous to India, its introduction can be traced to colonial influences and the subsequent globalization of culinary practices. In India, rosemary is primarily cultivated in home gardens or small-scale specialty farms in cooler, temperate regions such as parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and the Nilgiri Hills, where the climate is more conducive to its growth. Historically revered for its medicinal properties in ancient cultures, its presence in the Indian culinary landscape is a relatively modern phenomenon, reflecting an evolving palate and a growing appreciation for global ingredients.

In Indian home kitchens, rosemary has found its niche primarily in contemporary and fusion cooking rather than traditional preparations. Its robust, piney, peppery, and slightly balsamic flavour profile makes it an excellent accompaniment for roasted meats like chicken and lamb, often incorporated into marinades or rubs. It is also widely used with roasted vegetables, particularly potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms, imparting a distinctive aroma. While not a staple in traditional Indian curries or dals, it is increasingly featured in modern Indian dishes that blend Western techniques with local ingredients, such as rosemary-infused naans or tandoori preparations.

Industrially, rosemary and its derivatives are highly valued, particularly the rosemary extract. The whole herb is used in seasoning blends for processed foods, snack flavourings, and ready-to-eat meals, especially those with a Western or fusion profile. Rosemary extract, denoted by the F-EXTRACT tag, is a potent natural antioxidant, rich in compounds like carnosic acid and carnosol. This makes it a crucial ingredient in the food processing industry for extending the shelf life of oils, fats, and fat-containing products by preventing oxidative rancidity. It is also utilized in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors for its preservative and beneficial properties.

Consumers often encounter rosemary in two primary forms: the fresh or dried herb, and its concentrated extract. The herb is primarily used for its distinct flavour and aroma in cooking, while rosemary extract is predominantly employed for its powerful antioxidant capabilities, though it also contributes a subtle flavour. This distinction is crucial, as the extract's primary function is often preservation rather than direct seasoning. Rosemary should also not be confused with other aromatic herbs like thyme, which, while sharing some woody notes and culinary applications, possesses a different flavour profile and is botanically distinct.
