**Poppy Seed**

Poppy seeds, known as *khus khus* in Hindi and *posto* in Bengali, are the tiny, oil-rich seeds derived from the opium poppy (*Papaver somniferum*). Despite their botanical origin, culinary poppy seeds are harvested from fully mature, dried seed pods, ensuring they contain negligible to no psychoactive compounds, making them entirely safe for consumption. Their use in India dates back centuries, deeply embedded in traditional medicine and culinary practices, particularly in Eastern and Southern Indian cuisines. While India is a significant consumer, major global producers include Turkey, the Czech Republic, and France.

In Indian home kitchens, poppy seeds are prized for their unique nutty flavour, delicate crunch, and remarkable thickening properties. They are a cornerstone of Bengali cuisine, forming the base of iconic dishes like *Aloo Posto* (potatoes with poppy seed paste) and *Posto Bora* (poppy seed fritters), where they lend a creamy texture and earthy aroma. In other regions, they are ground into pastes to thicken gravies, curries, and kormas, or dry-roasted and sprinkled as a garnish on breads, sweets like *halwa* and *barfi*, and even some savoury snacks, adding a distinctive textural element.

Industrially, poppy seeds are primarily used in the bakery sector, incorporated into breads, rolls, bagels, and crackers for flavour and visual appeal. They are also found in various snack mixes, spice blends, and sometimes as a component in ready-to-eat meals or dessert toppings. Beyond the whole seed, poppy seed oil, extracted for its delicate flavour and nutritional profile, finds niche applications in gourmet cooking and salad dressings, though it is less common in mainstream Indian industrial food production compared to the seeds themselves.

A common point of confusion, particularly given their origin, is the safety and legality of culinary poppy seeds. It is crucial to understand that the seeds used in food are distinct from the opium latex derived from the unripe poppy capsule. Culinary poppy seeds are processed to remove any trace of alkaloids, rendering them non-narcotic and perfectly legal for consumption in India. They should not be conflated with the raw plant material or its psychoactive derivatives, which are strictly controlled.
