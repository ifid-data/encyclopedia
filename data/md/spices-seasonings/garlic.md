Garlic (*Allium sativum*), known as *Lahsun* in Hindi, *Vellulli* in Telugu, and *Poondu* in Tamil, boasts a rich history deeply intertwined with Indian culinary and medicinal traditions. Originating in Central Asia, garlic's presence in the Indian subcontinent dates back millennia, evidenced by ancient texts and archaeological findings. It quickly became an indispensable ingredient, revered not only for its pungent flavour but also for its perceived therapeutic properties in Ayurveda and Unani medicine. Today, India is one of the largest producers of garlic globally, with significant cultivation concentrated in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, where diverse varieties thrive in varying agro-climatic conditions.

In the Indian home kitchen, fresh garlic is a foundational ingredient, celebrated for its sharp, aromatic, and slightly spicy notes. It forms the aromatic base for countless curries, dals, and vegetable preparations, often paired with ginger in a classic *ginger-garlic paste*. Minced or crushed, it is essential for tempering (*tadka*), infusing hot oil with its distinctive flavour before adding to dishes. Beyond daily cooking, garlic finds its way into vibrant chutneys, piquant pickles, and marinades for meats and paneer, contributing depth and complexity. Roasted garlic, with its mellowed, sweeter profile, is a gourmet addition to breads, dips, and spreads.

The versatility of garlic extends significantly into industrial and modern food applications, driven by convenience and functional requirements. Dehydrated forms, including garlic powder, granulated garlic, and garlic flakes/bits, are staples in the FMCG sector. Garlic powder, with its concentrated flavour and fine texture, is widely used in spice blends, instant noodle seasonings, snack coatings (like chips and *namkeen*), and ready-to-cook mixes, ensuring uniform flavour distribution. Dehydrated garlic bits and flakes offer textural appeal and a more robust flavour profile in products like soups, sauces, and frozen meals. Garlic paste, often pre-packaged, provides a convenient base for gravies and marinades in both commercial kitchens and consumer households, streamlining preparation time.

A common point of confusion for consumers lies in distinguishing between fresh garlic and its various processed forms, particularly garlic paste and garlic powder. Fresh garlic offers a vibrant, complex, and pungent flavour profile that is unparalleled, best suited for dishes where its raw or lightly cooked essence is desired. Garlic paste, while convenient, often contains oil, salt, and preservatives, resulting in a slightly milder, less nuanced flavour compared to freshly minced garlic. Garlic powder and other dehydrated forms provide a concentrated, albeit flatter, garlic flavour, lacking the volatile compounds that give fresh garlic its characteristic aroma. These dehydrated forms are primarily used for dry applications, seasoning blends, or when rehydrated, for a quick flavour boost, but they cannot fully replicate the depth and pungency of fresh garlic.
