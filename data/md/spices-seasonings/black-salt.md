Black Salt, known canonically as *Kala Namak* in Hindi and *Krishnalavana* or *Sauvarchala Lavana* in Sanskrit, is a distinctive Indian rock salt with a rich history rooted in Ayurvedic tradition. Its origins trace back to ancient India, where it was revered not just as a seasoning but also for its purported therapeutic properties. Traditionally, it is produced by heating Himalayan rock salt in a furnace with specific herbs and spices, such as *harad* (Terminalia chebula), *amla* (Indian gooseberry), and *babul* bark, which infuse it with its characteristic sulfurous compounds. Major sourcing regions are often associated with the salt mines of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan, though the processing is deeply Indian.

In Indian home kitchens, Black Salt is an indispensable ingredient, celebrated for its pungent, savory, and slightly sulfurous aroma and taste. It is a cornerstone of many popular street foods and traditional dishes, including *chaats*, fruit salads, *raitas*, and refreshing beverages like *jaljeera* and *nimbu pani*. Its unique flavour profile is believed to enhance the taste of fresh produce and aid digestion, making it a popular addition to light meals and snacks. It is rarely used as a primary cooking salt but rather as a finishing seasoning.

Industrially, Black Salt finds extensive application in the FMCG sector, particularly in the production of snack seasonings for chips and *namkeen*, instant beverage mixes like *jaljeera* powder, and ready-to-eat *chaat* items. Its distinct flavour is highly valued for imparting an authentic Indian taste. Beyond traditional uses, its sulfurous notes have made it a popular ingredient in vegan cuisine, where it is often used to mimic the flavour of eggs in dishes like scrambled tofu, offering a unique functional application in modern food product development.

Consumers often confuse Black Salt with common table salt that has simply been coloured black. However, Black Salt is fundamentally different. While primarily composed of sodium chloride, its unique processing introduces iron sulfides and other trace minerals, which impart its characteristic dark purplish-pink hue (when ground) and its signature sulfurous aroma and taste. It is not merely a cosmetic variant but a distinct ingredient with a complex chemical composition and flavour profile, setting it apart from both white table salt and other specialty salts.
