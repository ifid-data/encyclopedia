**Coriander**

Coriander (*Coriandrum sativum*), known widely in India as *dhania* (from Sanskrit *dhanayaka*), is an ancient herb and spice with a rich history deeply interwoven with global culinary and medicinal traditions. Originating in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, coriander was introduced to India millennia ago, becoming an indispensable part of Ayurvedic medicine and regional cuisines. Today, India is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of coriander, with significant cultivation concentrated in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where its diverse forms are harvested for both domestic use and export.

In Indian home kitchens, coriander is celebrated for its dual identity as both a fresh herb and a dried spice. The vibrant green leaves (*hara dhania*) are a ubiquitous garnish, adding a burst of freshness and citrusy aroma to curries, dals, chutneys, and salads. Whole coriander seeds (*sabut dhania*) are often dry-roasted and ground to form the aromatic base of countless spice blends like garam masala, sambar powder, and curry powders, or used whole in tempering (*tadka*) to infuse oils with their warm, nutty flavour. Ground coriander powder (*dhania powder*) is a fundamental ingredient, thickening gravies and imparting a characteristic earthy depth to a wide array of dishes.

Beyond traditional home cooking, coriander finds extensive application in the modern food industry. Dehydrated or dried coriander leaves are incorporated into instant mixes, seasoning blends for snacks, and ready-to-eat meals, offering convenience and extended shelf life. Coriander seed powder is a staple in packaged spice blends, marinades, and processed foods, ensuring consistent flavour profiles. Furthermore, coriander extracts and distillates are utilized as natural flavouring agents in beverages, confectionery, and even in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, leveraging its aromatic compounds for diverse functional purposes.

A common point of confusion arises from the dual nature of the coriander plant itself. While the term "coriander" can refer to the entire plant, in Indian culinary parlance, "dhania" often specifically denotes the fresh leaves, which function as a herb with a bright, citrusy, and slightly peppery flavour. In contrast, "coriander seeds" are a distinct spice, possessing a warm, earthy, and nutty profile, especially when roasted. It is crucial to differentiate between these two parts, as their flavour contributions and applications in cooking are vastly different, despite originating from the same botanical source.
