### Seasoning

Seasoning, in the Indian culinary lexicon, transcends a mere flavour enhancer, embodying a rich tapestry of spices, herbs, and other aromatic ingredients meticulously blended to define the character of a dish. India, historically the "Spice Bowl of the World," has a heritage deeply intertwined with the cultivation, trade, and sophisticated application of spices. The concept of a "masala" – a term derived from Persian, meaning "ingredients" – is central to Indian cooking, representing a complex, often roasted and ground, mixture of spices that forms the flavour foundation of countless regional cuisines. From the ancient Ayurvedic texts detailing medicinal properties of spices to the Silk Road trade routes, India's contribution to the art of seasoning is unparalleled, with specific blends evolving over millennia to suit diverse palates and climatic conditions across the subcontinent.

In traditional Indian homes, seasoning is an art passed down through generations. Generic spice mixes are fundamental to daily cooking, used for tempering (tadka), marinating meats and vegetables, or as dry rubs. Iconic blends like Garam Masala, a warming mix of whole spices, are ubiquitous, lending depth to curries and gravies. Regional specialities such as Sambar Powder from the South, Rasam Powder, or the tangy, piquant Chaat Masala used in street food, exemplify the diversity and specificity of Indian seasoning. These blends are often prepared fresh, with spices roasted and ground at home, ensuring maximum aroma and flavour.

The industrial landscape has embraced the versatility of seasoning, particularly in the FMCG sector. Seasoning powders and spice blends are critical components in ready-to-eat meals, instant mixes, snack foods, and processed meats, offering consistent flavour profiles and extended shelf life. The use of concentrated forms like spice extracts allows for precise flavour delivery in beverages, sauces, and other applications where particulate matter is undesirable. These industrial applications leverage the functional properties of various spices, from their antioxidant capabilities to their ability to enhance palatability and mask undesirable notes, making them indispensable in modern food manufacturing.

A common point of confusion arises from the interchangeable use of "seasoning" and "masala." While all masalas are seasonings, not all seasonings are masalas. "Seasoning" is a broader term that can refer to a single spice (like salt or pepper) or a simple combination used to enhance flavour. "Masala," however, specifically denotes a complex, often multi-spice blend, typically roasted and ground, designed to impart a distinct, characteristic flavour profile to a particular dish or cuisine. For instance, a simple sprinkle of salt and chilli powder is a seasoning, but Garam Masala or Pani Puri Masala are specific, culturally defined blends with intricate compositions and intended culinary roles.
