# Lemongrass

Lemongrass, botanically known as *Cymbopogon citratus*, is an aromatic perennial grass native to Southeast Asia, though its cultivation and use have spread globally, including extensively across India. While not indigenous, it has been embraced in various Indian culinary and traditional practices, often referred to as "nimbu ghaas" (lemon grass) in Hindi, reflecting its distinct citrusy aroma. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for cultivation in many parts of India, particularly in the southern and northeastern states where it is integrated into local foodways and herbal traditions.

In Indian home kitchens, lemongrass is primarily valued for its refreshing, lemony, and slightly minty flavour profile. It is commonly used to prepare invigorating herbal teas, either on its own or blended with ginger and other spices, known for its digestive and soothing properties. Beyond beverages, the lower stalks and inner leaves are finely sliced or bruised and added to curries, broths, and marinades, particularly in dishes influenced by Southeast Asian cuisine, lending a bright, zesty note. It also features in some regional Indian preparations, especially in the Northeast, where fresh herbs are integral.

Industrially, lemongrass finds diverse applications, particularly in the FMCG sector. Its essential oil, extracted from the leaves, is a popular ingredient in aromatherapy, cosmetics, and natural insect repellents. In food manufacturing, dried lemongrass leaves and extracts are incorporated into herbal tea blends, health drinks, spice mixes, and ready-to-eat meals to impart a fresh, citrusy flavour. Its functional properties, including its antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, also make it a valuable addition to various processed food products and flavouring agents.

Consumers often confuse culinary lemongrass (*Cymbopogon citratus*) with citronella grass (*Cymbopogon nardus*), which shares a similar appearance and a strong, lemony scent. However, citronella is primarily cultivated for its essential oil, used extensively in perfumes, candles, and insect repellents, and is generally not used for culinary purposes due to its harsher flavour. While both belong to the *Cymbopogon* genus, true lemongrass offers a more refined and palatable citrus note, making it the preferred choice for food and beverage applications.
