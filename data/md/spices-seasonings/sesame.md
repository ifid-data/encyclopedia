# Sesame

Sesame (Sesamum indicum), known as 'Til' in Hindi, 'Ellu' in Tamil, and 'Nuvvulu' in Telugu, is one of the world's oldest cultivated oilseed crops, with archaeological evidence suggesting its domestication in the Indian subcontinent over 5,000 years ago. Its Sanskrit name, 'Tila', underscores its ancient and integral role in Indian culture and cuisine. Primarily grown in semi-arid tropical and subtropical regions, India is a significant global producer, with major cultivation areas spanning Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The plant yields small, flat, oval seeds, which can be white, black, or brown, each possessing distinct flavour profiles.

In Indian home kitchens, sesame seeds are a versatile ingredient, celebrated for their nutty flavour and delicate crunch. White sesame seeds are commonly used in traditional sweets like 'Til Ladoo', 'Chikki', and 'Gajak', especially during festivals like Makar Sankranti. They also serve as a garnish for breads, savouries, and are incorporated into spice blends and chutneys. Black sesame seeds, with their more robust flavour, are often preferred in Ayurvedic preparations and specific regional dishes. Sesame oil, extracted from the seeds, is a prized cooking medium, particularly in South Indian cuisine for tempering (tadka) and pickling, lending a distinctive aroma and taste. It's also traditionally used as a massage oil and in religious rituals.

The industrial food sector leverages sesame for both its seeds and oil. Sesame seeds are widely used as a topping for bakery products such as buns, crackers, and breadsticks, and as an ingredient in snack coatings, health bars, and granola. The oil, known for its stability due to natural antioxidants like sesamol and sesamolin, finds application in salad dressings, marinades, and as a flavouring agent in various processed foods. Its rich, nutty profile makes it a popular choice in Asian-inspired ready meals and sauces. Beyond food, sesame oil is a component in cosmetics, soaps, and traditional medicines, valued for its emollient and nourishing properties.

A common point of confusion arises between "sesame seeds" and "sesame oil," both derived from the same plant but serving different culinary functions. While the seeds provide texture and a concentrated nutty flavour, the oil offers a distinct aroma and acts as a cooking medium or flavour enhancer. Consumers might also differentiate between white (hulled) and black (unhulled) sesame seeds; white seeds are milder and visually appealing as a garnish, whereas black seeds have a stronger, earthier flavour and higher antioxidant content. It is also important to note that "til oil" is simply the Hindi term for sesame oil, not a separate product.
