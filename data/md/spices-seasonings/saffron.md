Saffron, known in India as *Kesar*, is derived from the dried stigmas of the *Crocus sativus* flower, a perennial plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. Its origins trace back to ancient Persia and Greece, with its introduction to India believed to have occurred through trade routes, establishing a deep cultural and culinary footprint, particularly in Kashmir. The name "saffron" itself is thought to be derived from the Arabic word "za'faran," meaning "yellow," while "Keshara" in Sanskrit refers to its thread-like appearance. India's primary saffron cultivation hub is the Pampore region of Kashmir, where the unique agro-climatic conditions yield some of the world's finest and most expensive saffron, revered for its distinct aroma, vibrant colour, and medicinal properties.

In Indian home kitchens, saffron is a prized ingredient, primarily used for its ability to impart a rich golden hue and a delicate, complex flavour profile—floral, honey-like, and subtly bitter. It is typically steeped in warm milk or water to release its full potential before being added to dishes. Saffron is indispensable in celebratory and festive preparations, gracing royal biryanis, rich kheer, phirni, shahi tukda, and a variety of traditional sweets (mithai). It is also a key ingredient in *kesar doodh* (saffron milk) and other traditional beverages, valued for both its taste and perceived health benefits in Ayurvedic practices.

Industrially, saffron finds its application predominantly in premium food and beverage segments. It is a sought-after natural colourant and flavouring agent in high-end dairy products like ice creams, yogurts, and packaged traditional Indian desserts. Its use extends to health drinks, herbal teas, and certain cosmetic and Ayurvedic formulations, where its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are leveraged. Due to its high cost, industrial applications often involve saffron extracts or infusions to ensure consistent flavour and colour delivery while managing expenditure.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding saffron, primarily due to its high price leading to adulteration or substitution with cheaper alternatives. The most common confusions arise with turmeric (*Haldi*) and safflower (*Kusum*), both of which can mimic saffron's yellow-orange colour but lack its characteristic aroma and nuanced flavour. Genuine saffron is identifiable by its distinct, delicate threads (stigmas), which are trumpet-shaped at one end, unlike the uniform strands of common adulterants. Furthermore, saffron's unique, lingering fragrance and complex taste are impossible to replicate with mere colourants, making it crucial to distinguish between the authentic spice and its imitations.
