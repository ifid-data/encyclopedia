Chives (scientific name *Allium schoenoprasum*) are a delicate, perennial herb belonging to the *Allium* family, which also includes onions, garlic, leeks, and shallots. Native to Europe, Asia, and North America, chives are among the smallest species of the edible alliums. While not indigenous to traditional Indian culinary landscapes, their cultivation has seen a rise in India, particularly in cooler regions and for gourmet produce, catering to a growing demand for global cuisines. The name "chive" is derived from the Old French word "cive," itself stemming from the Latin "cepa," meaning onion, highlighting its botanical kinship.

In home kitchens, chives are primarily valued for their mild, fresh, onion-like flavour and vibrant green colour, making them an excellent garnish. Unlike their more pungent relatives, chives offer a subtle aromatic note that enhances dishes without overpowering them. They are commonly snipped fresh and sprinkled over salads, omelettes, scrambled eggs, soups, baked potatoes, and creamy dips. While not a staple in traditional Indian cooking, their delicate flavour profile makes them a versatile addition to modern Indian fusion dishes, where they can provide a fresh counterpoint to richer flavours, or as a sophisticated garnish for contemporary preparations.

Industrially, chives are less prevalent as a primary flavouring agent in large-scale Indian FMCG products compared to more robust spices. However, they are increasingly found in dried or freeze-dried forms within seasoning blends for continental snacks, instant soups, salad dressings, and gourmet meal kits. Their delicate flavour and aroma are best preserved when fresh, which limits their extensive use in processed foods where heat treatment can diminish their characteristic notes. In modern culinary establishments, fresh chives are a standard ingredient for garnishing and flavouring, especially in European and East Asian-inspired dishes.

A common point of confusion arises from the visual similarity between chives and the green tops of spring onions (scallions), particularly in the Indian context where "chives" might not be a distinct culinary term for everyone. However, chives are significantly thinner, have hollow, grass-like leaves, and possess a much milder, more refined onion flavour. They are also distinct from garlic chives (*Allium tuberosum*), which have flat leaves and a pronounced garlicky taste. Understanding these distinctions is key to appreciating the unique delicate flavour that chives bring to a dish.
