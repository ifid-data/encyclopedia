**Mint**

Mint, known colloquially across India as *Pudina* (from Sanskrit *pudina*), is a revered aromatic herb with a rich history deeply intertwined with global and Indian culinary and medicinal traditions. Originating in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, mint varieties were introduced to India centuries ago, finding fertile ground and integrating seamlessly into local agriculture and gastronomy. Its widespread cultivation, from small kitchen gardens to commercial farms across states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh, underscores its ubiquitous presence. The term "Mint" generally refers to species within the *Mentha* genus, with spearmint (*Mentha spicata*) and peppermint (*Mentha piperita*) being the most common, both valued for their distinctive volatile oils.

In Indian home kitchens, mint leaves are indispensable, celebrated for their refreshing, cooling, and pungent notes. Fresh mint leaves are a cornerstone of vibrant chutneys, often paired with coriander, tamarind, or raw mango, serving as a piquant accompaniment to meals and snacks. They are also central to *raitas*, lending a refreshing counterpoint to spicy dishes, and are frequently muddled into cooling beverages like *nimbu pani* (lemonade) or *jaljeera*. Dried mint, or *sukhi pudina*, offers a more concentrated flavour and is often crumbled over *chaats*, curries, or used in spice blends like *garam masala* for a subtle aromatic depth. Mint puree finds its way into marinades for meats and vegetables, infusing them with its characteristic zest.

Beyond traditional home cooking, mint is a significant ingredient in the industrial food and beverage sector. Its robust flavour profile makes it a popular choice for a wide array of FMCG products. Mint extracts and essential oils are extensively used as flavouring agents in confectionery, chewing gums, toothpastes, mouthwashes, and various beverages. Dried mint powder is a common component in instant snack seasonings, such as the "tangy-pudina" flavour found in chips and savouries, providing a consistent and long-lasting taste. Its functional properties, including its refreshing sensation and digestive aid, also make it valuable in health and wellness products.

Consumers often encounter "Mint" and "Pudina" interchangeably, and it's important to clarify that these terms refer to the same botanical ingredient, with "Pudina" being the widely adopted Indian nomenclature. A common distinction arises between fresh mint leaves and dried mint. While fresh leaves offer a bright, vibrant, and slightly peppery flavour, dried mint provides a more intense, concentrated, and earthy aroma, making it suitable for different culinary applications. Furthermore, mint should not be confused with other aromatic herbs like coriander or parsley, as its unique mentholated profile sets it apart, though it often complements them in complex flavour compositions.
