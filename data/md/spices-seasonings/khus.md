# Khus

Khus, botanically known as *Vetiveria zizanioides*, is a perennial grass indigenous to India, deeply woven into the subcontinent's cultural and culinary fabric. The name "Khus" itself is derived from Sanskrit, reflecting its ancient recognition. While it thrives across various regions, it is particularly cultivated in the northern plains of India, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where its extensive root system is harvested. These roots are the primary source of its distinctive aroma and flavour, traditionally extracted through distillation or maceration. Beyond its aromatic properties, Vetiver grass has historically been valued for its role in soil conservation and traditional medicine.

In Indian home kitchens, Khus is primarily celebrated for its unique cooling properties and earthy, woody, and slightly sweet aroma. Its most iconic culinary application is in the preparation of Khus sharbat, a refreshing summer beverage made from the concentrated syrup of its root extract. This vibrant green drink is a staple during hot months, offering a soothing and aromatic respite. Beyond sharbat, Khus is occasionally used to infuse water, flavour kulfi, or impart a subtle, grounding note to certain traditional desserts, though its presence in everyday cooking is less common than in beverages.

The distinctive profile of Khus has found significant traction in the industrial food and beverage sector. Khus extracts and distillates are widely utilized in the production of commercial sharbats, ready-to-drink beverages, and flavouring agents for ice creams and confectionery. The essential oil, obtained through steam distillation of the roots, is highly prized in global perfumery and aromatherapy for its complex, long-lasting, and grounding fragrance. In modern FMCG, the root extract is the preferred form for imparting flavour, while the distillate is often reserved for high-end flavourings or non-food applications like cosmetics.

A common point of confusion arises from the various forms and potential misnomers associated with Khus. Consumers often encounter "khus roots extract" and "distillate of khus," both derived from the same *Vetiveria zizanioides* plant but differing in concentration and processing. The extract typically refers to a flavouring agent, while the distillate is the essential oil or hydrosol. It is crucial to distinguish authentic Khus products from any synthetic alternatives or products labelled as "distillate of khas," which may not originate from the true Vetiver grass and thus lack its characteristic natural aroma and therapeutic properties.
