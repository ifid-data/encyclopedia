## Mustard

Mustard, derived from plants of the *Brassica* and *Sinapis* genera, holds a venerable position in Indian culinary and cultural heritage. Its origins trace back to ancient civilizations, with archaeological evidence suggesting its use as a spice and medicinal herb for millennia. In India, mustard cultivation is widespread, particularly in states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and West Bengal, where it thrives as a crucial oilseed and leafy vegetable crop. The Sanskrit term *sarṣapa* underscores its deep historical roots in the subcontinent, giving rise to regional names like *sarson* (Hindi) and *rai* (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati).

In traditional Indian home kitchens, mustard seeds are indispensable for tempering (*tadka* or *chhonk*), where they are spluttered in hot oil to release their pungent, nutty aroma, forming the flavour base for dals, curries, and vegetable preparations. Black mustard seeds (*rai*) are most commonly used for this purpose, while yellow mustard seeds (*peeli sarson*) are often ground into a paste for pickles, chutneys, and specific Bengali fish preparations like *Shorshe Maach*. Beyond the seeds, the tender leaves of the mustard plant (*sarson ka saag*) are a winter delicacy, particularly in Punjab, cooked into a rich, nutritious green curry. Roasted mustard seeds are sometimes used as a crunchy garnish or ground into spice blends for a deeper, more mellow flavour.

Industrially, mustard finds extensive application, primarily in the production of mustard oil, a pungent cooking medium widely used across North and East India. Mustard seeds are also processed into mustard powder, which serves as a key ingredient in various condiments, sauces, and salad dressings. In the FMCG sector, mustard paste is incorporated into ready-to-eat meals, marinades, and snack seasonings, leveraging its distinct flavour profile. The functional properties of mustard, including its emulsifying and preservative qualities, also make it valuable in food processing.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the various forms of mustard. The primary distinction lies between the whole mustard seeds (black, brown, or yellow), the leafy greens (*sarson ka saag*), and the culinary paste. While the seeds are primarily used for tempering and flavouring, the leaves are consumed as a vegetable. It is also crucial to differentiate between mustard seeds and mustard oil, which is extracted from the seeds and used as a cooking fat. Furthermore, the different varieties of mustard seeds possess distinct pungency levels and flavour nuances, influencing their specific culinary applications.
