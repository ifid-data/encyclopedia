### Oregano

Oregano, derived from the Greek "oros ganos" meaning "joy of the mountain," is a pungent, aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Western Asia. While not indigenous to traditional Indian culinary heritage, its global popularity, particularly through Italian and Mexican cuisines, has led to its widespread adoption in modern Indian kitchens. Historically, it has been revered for both its culinary and medicinal properties across various ancient cultures. In India, commercial cultivation is limited, with most of the culinary oregano being imported or grown in small-scale, specialized farms to cater to the growing demand for international flavours.

In Indian home kitchens, oregano is primarily a seasoning for dishes influenced by global culinary trends. It is a staple for flavouring pizzas, pasta sauces, garlic bread, and as a sprinkle over roasted vegetables or meats. Its robust, slightly bitter, and peppery notes complement a range of savoury preparations, adding a distinct Mediterranean character. Unlike traditional Indian spices which are often ground and cooked into gravies, oregano is typically used as a finishing herb or infused into oils, providing an aromatic top note rather than a foundational flavour.

Industrially, dried oregano is a ubiquitous ingredient in India's burgeoning FMCG sector. It is extensively used in seasoning sachets for instant noodles, flavouring blends for potato chips and other savoury snacks, and in ready-to-eat meals that feature Western or fusion profiles. Its stability in dried form makes it ideal for mass production, ensuring consistent flavour and extended shelf life. Oregano oleoresins are also employed in some applications for a more concentrated flavour profile, particularly in sauces and marinades where a potent, consistent aroma is desired.

A common point of confusion arises between oregano (*Origanum vulgare*) and marjoram (*Origanum majorana*), often referred to as sweet marjoram. While both belong to the *Origanum* genus and share a similar appearance, their flavour profiles are distinct. True oregano is more assertive, pungent, and peppery, with a slightly bitter undertone, making it suitable for robust dishes. Marjoram, conversely, is milder, sweeter, and more floral, offering a delicate aroma. Consumers also often note the difference between fresh and dried oregano, with the dried form being significantly more concentrated in flavour due to the dehydration process.
