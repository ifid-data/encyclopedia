**Curry Leaves**

Curry leaves, derived from the plant *Murraya koenigii*, are an aromatic herb deeply ingrained in the culinary and cultural fabric of India, particularly its southern regions. Native to the Indian subcontinent, the plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, with significant cultivation in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The name "curry" itself is believed to originate from the Tamil word "kari," referring to a sauce or gravy, highlighting the leaf's indispensable role in such preparations. Beyond their culinary significance, curry leaves have been traditionally valued in Ayurvedic medicine for their purported digestive and medicinal properties.

In home kitchens across India, especially in the south, fresh curry leaves are a cornerstone of daily cooking. They are almost exclusively used as a tempering agent (tadka or chaunk), where they are briefly fried in hot oil or ghee alongside mustard seeds, urad dal, and dried chillies. This process releases their distinctive pungent, slightly nutty, and citrusy aroma, infusing dishes like sambar, rasam, various curries, chutneys, poriyals, and upma. While less prevalent in traditional North Indian cuisine, their unique flavour profile is increasingly appreciated and incorporated into diverse preparations.

Industrially, curry leaves find application in various processed food products. Dried curry leaves are used in spice blends, ready-to-eat meals, and snack seasonings, particularly for namkeen and chips, where they contribute an authentic Indian flavour. Oleoresins and extracts derived from the leaves are also employed as natural flavouring agents in the FMCG sector. Furthermore, their perceived health benefits have led to their inclusion in some health supplements and herbal formulations, leveraging both their traditional reputation and distinct taste.

A common point of confusion arises from the name "curry leaves" itself, often leading consumers to conflate them with "curry powder." It is crucial to understand that curry leaves are a single, distinct herb (*Murraya koenigii*), while curry powder is a complex blend of various ground spices (such as turmeric, coriander, cumin, and fenugreek). They are entirely different ingredients with unique flavour profiles and culinary applications. Curry leaves are also distinct from bay leaves, which come from a different plant and possess a different aroma and taste.
