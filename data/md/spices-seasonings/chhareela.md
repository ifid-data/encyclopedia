**Chhareela**

Chhareela, scientifically known as *Parmotrema perlatum*, is a unique edible lichen deeply embedded in the culinary heritage of India, particularly in North Indian and Hyderabadi cuisines. Often referred to as "Pathar Phool" (stone flower) in Hindi, it is not a flower but a symbiotic organism of fungi and algae that grows on rocks and trees. Its historical use dates back centuries, with mentions in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani texts for its aromatic and purported medicinal properties. Primarily sourced from the hilly regions of the Himalayas and the Western Ghats, its collection is often a manual process, reflecting its wild and natural origins.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Chhareela is prized for its distinctive earthy, woody, and slightly musky aroma, which it imparts to slow-cooked dishes. It is rarely used as a standalone spice but is a crucial component of complex spice blends, most notably certain regional garam masalas. Before use, it is typically dry-roasted to intensify its fragrance, then ground into a powder or added whole to dishes like Nihari, Haleem, various meat curries, and some vegetarian preparations, where it contributes a deep, foundational flavour profile often associated with "dum" cooking.

The unique flavour profile of Chhareela has found its way into modern industrial food applications. "Chhareela flavouring" is developed for use in ready-to-eat spice mixes, marinades, and processed foods, aiming to replicate the authentic taste of traditional Indian slow-cooked dishes. The "distillate of chhareela" represents a more concentrated liquid extract, offering a consistent and precise flavour delivery for manufacturers. These forms are particularly valuable in FMCG products like snack seasonings, instant meal kits, and even some savoury beverages, where a natural, earthy, and complex aroma is desired without the need for the raw lichen.

Consumers often encounter Chhareela as a dried, moss-like ingredient, which can lead to confusion regarding its identity as a spice. Despite its Hindi name "Pathar Phool," it is not a botanical flower but a lichen, distinct from other floral or seed-based spices. It is also important to differentiate the whole lichen, which infuses a subtle, nuanced flavour over time in traditional cooking, from its concentrated flavouring or distillate forms. While the whole ingredient is ideal for slow-cooked, aromatic depth, the processed flavourings and distillates offer convenience and consistency for industrial applications, providing the characteristic Chhareela essence in a more controlled manner.
