# Thyme

Thyme, derived from the Greek "thymos" meaning courage or perfume, is an aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean region, widely appreciated for its distinctive flavour and fragrance. While not indigenous to India, its presence in Indian culinary landscapes is a result of global culinary exchange and the increasing popularity of international cuisines. Historically, thyme has been revered for both its culinary and medicinal properties across ancient civilizations. In India, commercial cultivation is limited, often found in temperate regions or grown in home gardens for personal use, with a significant portion of the market relying on imported dried or fresh varieties.

In Indian home kitchens, thyme is primarily utilized in dishes influenced by Western culinary traditions. It is a popular ingredient in marinades for meats and poultry, lending an earthy, minty, and slightly lemony note. It finds its way into soups, stews, roasted vegetables, and pasta sauces, where its robust flavour can withstand longer cooking times. While not a staple in traditional Indian curries or dals, it occasionally appears in fusion dishes or experimental cooking, offering a unique aromatic dimension distinct from native Indian herbs.

Industrially, thyme is a common component in the FMCG sector, particularly in seasoning blends for processed foods like chips, instant noodles, and ready-to-eat meals with a global flavour profile. Its essential oil is extracted for use in flavourings, while dried thyme leaves are incorporated for both taste and visual appeal in products such as herb mixes, pizza seasonings, and Western-style bakery items. Its antimicrobial properties also make it valuable in certain food preservation applications and herbal formulations.

Consumers in India often encounter thyme as part of "mixed herbs" or "Italian seasoning" blends, leading to a general understanding of its flavour rather than a specific recognition of the individual herb. It is crucial to distinguish thyme from traditional Indian aromatic herbs like curry leaves, mint, or coriander, as its flavour profile—earthy, slightly floral, and with a hint of citrus—is markedly different and serves distinct culinary purposes. Unlike many Indian spices that are often toasted or ground into masalas, thyme is typically used whole or lightly crushed, either fresh or dried, to infuse dishes with its characteristic aroma.
