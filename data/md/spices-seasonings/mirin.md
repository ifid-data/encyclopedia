# Mirin

Mirin, a foundational ingredient in Japanese cuisine, is a sweet rice wine integral to its distinctive flavour profile. Originating in Japan during the Sengoku period (15th-17th century) as a sweet alcoholic beverage, it evolved into a culinary staple. Traditionally, mirin is produced by fermenting glutinous rice, koji (a type of mould), and shochu (a distilled spirit) over a period of 40-60 days, resulting in a complex liquid with a delicate sweetness and umami depth. Its introduction to India is relatively recent, coinciding with the growing popularity of pan-Asian and Japanese culinary traditions, primarily through imported varieties.

In traditional Japanese home cooking, mirin is indispensable. It imparts a mild sweetness, a glossy sheen to dishes, and helps to tenderize proteins while masking undesirable odours in fish and meat. It is a key component in glazes like teriyaki, marinades for grilled items, dipping sauces, and broths such as dashi. In Indian kitchens exploring global flavours, mirin finds its way into fusion stir-fries, marinades for Asian-inspired grilled chicken or paneer, and dressings, where its unique sweet-umami balance enhances the overall taste.

Industrially, mirin and its derivatives are widely used in the FMCG sector, particularly in the production of ready-to-eat Asian sauces, marinades, instant noodle flavourings, and salad dressings. Due to its alcohol content, "Aji-Mirin" or "Mirin-fu" (mirin-like seasoning) has gained prominence. These are often lower in alcohol or alcohol-free, formulated with ingredients like glucose syrup, rice, water, and flavourings, making them more accessible for a broader consumer base and for industrial applications requiring specific alcohol content regulations or extended shelf life.

Consumers often confuse mirin with sake or rice vinegar, given their shared rice base and Japanese origin. However, mirin is distinctly sweeter and has a lower alcohol content (typically 14% ABV for hon-mirin, or true mirin) compared to sake, which is primarily a beverage with higher alcohol and less sweetness. Rice vinegar, on the other hand, is acidic and lacks the sweetness and umami complexity of mirin. In India, the term "mirin rice wine" clarifies its nature, but it's crucial to distinguish it from its non-alcoholic or low-alcohol "Aji-Mirin" counterparts, which are more commonly found and used as substitutes.
