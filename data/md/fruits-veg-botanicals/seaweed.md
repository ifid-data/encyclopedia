# Seaweed

Seaweed refers to various species of marine algae, a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms found in oceans and coastal waters worldwide. While seaweed boasts a millennia-old culinary heritage in East Asian cuisines, particularly in Japan, Korea, and China, its introduction and widespread adoption in mainstream Indian gastronomy are relatively recent. Historically, certain coastal communities in India may have utilized local marine flora for sustenance or traditional medicine, but a pan-Indian culinary tradition centered around seaweed is absent. The growing global interest in its nutritional profile and the influence of international food trends are now driving nascent cultivation efforts along India's extensive coastline, with states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat exploring its potential.

Within Indian home kitchens, seaweed is not a traditional staple but rather a modern ingredient, often encountered through exposure to global cuisines. It is increasingly appreciated for its unique umami flavour and textural contributions. Home cooks might incorporate rehydrated seaweed into contemporary salads, stir-fries, or broths. Processed forms, such as roasted seaweed sheets (nori), are gaining popularity as a convenient, crunchy snack, a garnish for various dishes, or as a wrap for rice and vegetable preparations, reflecting a fusion of global and local culinary practices.

Industrially, seaweed finds extensive applications beyond direct culinary use. Extracts like agar-agar (INS 406) and carrageenan (INS 407) are widely employed as gelling agents, thickeners, and stabilizers in a vast array of FMCG products, including desserts, dairy alternatives, and processed foods. Roasted seaweed, particularly nori, is a prominent ready-to-eat snack, valued for its crisp texture and savoury profile. Furthermore, seaweed is a rich source of minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds, leading to its incorporation into health supplements, animal feed, and even cosmetic formulations.

In the Indian context, a common point of confusion stems from the general unfamiliarity with seaweed as a food item, often leading to it being broadly conflated with land-based green leafy vegetables. More specifically, consumers may not differentiate between raw, dried, and roasted forms. While dried seaweed typically requires rehydration and cooking, roasted seaweed is a seasoned, ready-to-eat product, offering a distinct crispness and intensified flavour profile. It is also important to understand that "seaweed" specifically denotes marine algae, which are biologically distinct from vascular plants that may grow in marine environments.
