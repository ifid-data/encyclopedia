**Juice Concentrate**

Juice concentrate represents a significant advancement in food preservation, tracing its modern industrial origins to the early 20th century, though ancient cultures practiced rudimentary forms of fruit juice reduction for preservation and sweetening. In India, the concept gained prominence with the rise of packaged beverages, allowing for the year-round availability of seasonal fruits. Sourcing for concentrates primarily involves major fruit-growing regions across India, such as Maharashtra for oranges and grapes, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for mangoes, and Himachal Pradesh for apples, where fruits are processed close to their harvest to ensure freshness before concentration. The term "concentrate" itself is English, denoting a substance where the solvent (water) has been largely removed to increase the proportion of the solute (fruit solids).

In Indian home kitchens, juice concentrate is predominantly used for its primary purpose: reconstitution into a beverage by adding water. It offers a convenient alternative to fresh juice, especially for busy households or when specific fruits are out of season. Beyond simple drinks, concentrates are occasionally incorporated into homemade desserts, fruit sauces, or as a flavour base for mocktails and cocktails, providing an intense fruit flavour without adding excessive liquid. While not a traditional ingredient in the same vein as spices or dals, its convenience has made it a staple in modern Indian culinary practices.

Industrially, juice concentrate is a cornerstone of the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) beverage sector. Its primary functional advantage lies in its reduced volume and weight, significantly lowering storage and transportation costs compared to fresh juice. This concentrated form, achieved by evaporating water from fresh juice, is then used to produce a vast array of packaged juices, squashes, cordials, and fruit-based drinks by simply adding water back. Furthermore, it finds extensive application in the food processing industry for confectionery, dairy products like yogurts and ice creams, bakery fillings, and even some savoury sauces, providing consistent fruit flavour and colour irrespective of seasonal fruit availability.

A common point of confusion for consumers lies in distinguishing between "freshly squeezed juice," "juice from concentrate," and "not from concentrate" (NFC) juice. Juice concentrate is essentially fresh juice from which most of the water has been removed, resulting in a thick, viscous syrup. "Juice from concentrate" refers to a product where water has been added back to this concentrate to restore it to its original juice consistency. In contrast, "not from concentrate" (NFC) juice is pasteurized juice that has not undergone the water removal and re-addition process. While concentration effectively preserves the juice and its nutrients, the evaporation process can sometimes alter the delicate balance of volatile flavour compounds, leading to a slightly different taste profile compared to truly fresh or NFC juice.
