# Green Tea

Green tea, derived from the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant, holds a revered place in global beverage culture, with its origins deeply rooted in ancient China. While India is predominantly known for its robust black teas, the cultivation and consumption of green tea have steadily grown, particularly in regions like Darjeeling, Nilgiris, and Assam, where specific terroir contributes to unique flavour profiles. Historically, tea, or "chai," was introduced to India by the British, but the unoxidized form of green tea has found increasing favour, often associated with traditional wellness practices and its mention in Ayurvedic texts for its purported health benefits.

In Indian home kitchens, green tea is primarily consumed as a health-conscious beverage. Unlike the ubiquitous milk-and-sugar-laden black tea, green tea is typically brewed with hot water, often without any additions, allowing its characteristic grassy, vegetal, or sometimes nutty notes to shine. Variants like Jasmine green tea, where tea leaves are scented with jasmine blossoms, are also popular, offering a fragrant and soothing experience. It is increasingly replacing traditional morning or evening chai for those seeking a lighter, antioxidant-rich alternative.

Industrially, green tea finds diverse applications within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Beyond packaged loose leaf and tea bags, green tea extract is a significant functional ingredient. This concentrated form, rich in catechins and other antioxidants, is widely incorporated into health supplements, ready-to-drink beverages, and even certain food products for its perceived wellness benefits. Its natural flavour and subtle colour also make it a popular additive in confectionery, snacks, and cosmetic formulations, leveraging its natural appeal and functional properties.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the various forms of green tea. The primary distinction lies between green tea leaves, which are minimally processed and unoxidized, and black tea, which undergoes full oxidation, resulting in different flavour profiles and chemical compositions. Furthermore, green tea extract is a concentrated form derived from the leaves, distinct from the brewed beverage. While the leaves are used for traditional brewing, the extract is a potent ingredient for functional foods and supplements, offering a concentrated dose of its active compounds. Flavoured variants, such as Jasmine green tea, are simply green tea leaves infused with other botanicals, not a different type of tea altogether.
