# Tangerine

The tangerine, a vibrant citrus fruit, is a cultivar group of mandarin oranges (Citrus reticulata). Its origins trace back to Southeast Asia, particularly China, from where it spread globally through ancient trade routes. The name "tangerine" itself is derived from Tangier, Morocco, a significant port from which these fruits were first shipped to Europe. In India, tangerines, often broadly categorized under *santre* or *narangi* (terms for oranges), have been cultivated for centuries. Major growing regions include Maharashtra, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and parts of the North Eastern states, where the climate is conducive to citrus cultivation.

In Indian home kitchens, tangerines are primarily enjoyed as a refreshing, seasonal fruit, consumed fresh for their sweet-tart flavour and high vitamin C content. They are a popular choice for breakfast or as a healthy snack. Homemakers often extract fresh juice for direct consumption or to prepare simple beverages. The zest and segments can also be incorporated into fruit salads, desserts, and occasionally into homemade marmalades or jams, offering a bright, aromatic note. While not a staple in traditional cooked Indian dishes, their vibrant flavour lends itself well to modern culinary experiments, particularly in fusion desserts or marinades.

Industrially, tangerines are extensively processed, with "tangerine juice concentrate" being a significant product. This concentrate is produced by removing water from fresh tangerine juice, resulting in a shelf-stable, reduced-volume product that significantly lowers storage and transportation costs. It is a key ingredient in the beverage industry for manufacturing packaged juices, squashes, and carbonated drinks. Furthermore, tangerine concentrate and flavourings derived from it are utilized in confectionery, baked goods, ice creams, and dairy products to impart a natural citrus flavour. Its availability in canned forms ensures convenience and extended shelf life for both industrial and consumer markets.

A common point of confusion arises between the fresh tangerine fruit and its processed form, tangerine juice concentrate. The fresh tangerine is a whole, perishable fruit, enjoyed directly for its texture, aroma, and nutritional value. In contrast, tangerine juice concentrate is a highly processed product where water has been extracted, making it a dense, shelf-stable ingredient primarily used for reconstitution in beverages and as a flavouring agent in various food products. While both originate from the same fruit, their physical form, shelf life, and primary applications differ significantly, with the concentrate offering convenience and consistency for large-scale food production.
