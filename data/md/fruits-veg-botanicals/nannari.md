**Nannari**

Nannari, botanically known as *Hemidesmus indicus*, is a revered root indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, particularly prevalent in the Southern states. Often referred to as Indian Sarsaparilla, its name "Nannari" itself, derived from Tamil and Malayalam, signifies "good fragrance," a testament to its distinctive aromatic properties. For centuries, this root has been a cornerstone in Ayurvedic and Siddha traditional medicine, valued for its cooling, detoxifying, and blood-purifying attributes. Historically, it was wild-harvested from forests, though some cultivation now occurs to meet demand, primarily in regions like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu.

In traditional Indian homes, Nannari is primarily celebrated for its refreshing culinary applications, especially during the scorching summer months. The roots are meticulously cleaned, gently bruised or crushed, and then steeped in water to extract their unique flavour and aroma. This infusion forms the base for the iconic Nannari sherbet, a cooling beverage typically sweetened with jaggery or sugar and brightened with a squeeze of lime. Its flavour profile is complex – earthy, subtly sweet, with vanilla-like undertones and a pronounced aromatic freshness that provides an immediate sense of relief from heat. Beyond sherbets, it's also used in various herbal infusions and traditional remedies.

In contemporary industrial applications, Nannari has transitioned from a purely home-based ingredient to a popular flavouring in the FMCG sector. Bottled Nannari syrups are widely available, offering a convenient way to prepare the traditional drink. Its perceived health benefits, particularly its cooling and detoxifying properties, make it a sought-after ingredient in health drinks, herbal teas, and certain nutraceutical formulations. The unique aromatic compounds of Nannari are also extracted and used as natural flavouring agents in a range of beverages and food products, catering to a growing consumer preference for traditional and natural ingredients.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding Nannari, frequently conflating it with the American Sarsaparilla (*Smilax ornata*) or other root beers. It is crucial to distinguish Nannari as *Indian* Sarsaparilla, possessing a unique phytochemical composition and a distinct, more delicate aromatic profile compared to its American counterpart. Furthermore, its traditional preparation and flavour are often mimicked by artificial flavourings, leading to a diluted experience. True Nannari offers a specific, earthy-vanilla aroma and a profound cooling sensation that sets it apart from generic root-based beverages or synthetic imitations.
