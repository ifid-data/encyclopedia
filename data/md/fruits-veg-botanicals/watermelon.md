**Watermelon**

Watermelon, scientifically *Citrullus lanatus*, is a globally cherished fruit with a rich history, believed to have originated in the Kalahari Desert of Africa. Its cultivation dates back thousands of years, with evidence found in ancient Egyptian tombs. Introduced to India through ancient trade routes, possibly from Persia or Central Asia, it quickly became an integral part of the subcontinent's summer diet. Known as *Tarbooz* in Hindi and many other Indian languages, it is widely cultivated across India, particularly in warmer states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh, thriving in sandy riverbeds and plains. Its cultural significance in India is profound, symbolizing refreshment and relief during the scorching summer months.

In Indian home kitchens, watermelon is predominantly enjoyed fresh and raw, sliced or cubed, as a hydrating fruit. Its high water content makes it a popular choice for juices, *sharbat*, and smoothies, often blended with mint or a touch of black salt for an invigorating summer drink. While less common, some innovative culinary applications include watermelon salads, often paired with feta or mint, and even a unique *raita* in certain regional cuisines. The seeds, often discarded, are also traditionally consumed after roasting, known as *magaz*, and are a valuable ingredient in sweets, savouries, and spice blends for their nutty flavour and nutritional benefits.

Industrially, watermelon finds extensive application in the beverage sector, forming the base for packaged juices, fruit drinks, and refreshing blends. Its natural sweetness and vibrant colour make it a popular flavouring agent and extract in confectionery, ice creams, and sorbets. Beyond direct consumption, watermelon seed oil is extracted for its nutritional profile, used in some niche food products and increasingly in the cosmetic industry for its moisturizing properties. The fruit's pulp and rind extracts are also explored for functional ingredients in health supplements and skincare products, leveraging its antioxidant and hydrating qualities.

Consumers often group watermelon with other melons like muskmelon (*kharbuja*) or cantaloupe, yet it stands distinct within the *Cucurbitaceae* family due to its unique texture, extremely high water content, and typically larger size. A common point of confusion or oversight is the edibility and nutritional value of its seeds; while often discarded, roasted watermelon seeds (*magaz*) are a traditional and nutritious snack, rich in protein and micronutrients, and should not be conflated with the seeds of other fruits. Its reputation as a "cooling" fruit is well-deserved, primarily due to its significant hydration capacity, making it a quintessential summer staple.
