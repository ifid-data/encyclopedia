Bael, scientifically known as *Aegle marmelos*, is a revered fruit deeply embedded in India's cultural and culinary landscape. Native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, its origins trace back millennia, with mentions in ancient Sanskrit texts as 'Bilva'. The tree itself holds immense sacred significance in Hinduism, particularly associated with Lord Shiva, and its leaves are offered in worship. Linguistically, it is known as Bael in Hindi, Bilva in Sanskrit, and commonly referred to as Wood Apple in English, though this can sometimes lead to confusion with other species. Bael trees thrive across India, especially in drier regions, and are cultivated for both their fruit and medicinal properties.

In traditional Indian homes, bael fruit is primarily celebrated for its cooling and digestive properties. The fresh fruit, with its hard woody shell, is carefully cracked open to reveal a fragrant, fibrous, and mucilaginous pulp. This pulp is most famously used to prepare a refreshing sherbet, particularly popular during the hot summer months, known for its ability to soothe the stomach and combat heatstroke. Beyond beverages, the pulp is also incorporated into jams, preserves, and sometimes even dried and powdered for long-term storage and use in Ayurvedic remedies.

Industrially, bael finds significant application, particularly in the health and wellness sector. The bael pulp (M-PULP) is processed and often canned (P-CAN) or packaged as a concentrate to ensure year-round availability and consistent quality for manufacturers. This processed pulp is a key ingredient in a range of FMCG products, including health drinks, fruit juices, herbal formulations, and even some functional food bars. Its unique flavour profile and perceived health benefits make it a valuable component in products targeting digestive health and natural wellness, leveraging its traditional reputation in a modern context.

Consumers often encounter bael in two primary forms: the fresh, hard-shelled fruit and the ready-to-use bael pulp. The fresh fruit requires effort to extract the pulp, which is often fibrous and contains seeds, while the processed bael pulp offers convenience, being deseeded and standardized for immediate use in drinks or recipes. It is important to distinguish *Aegle marmelos* from other fruits sometimes also called "wood apple," such as *Limonia acidissima* (also known as Kaitha or Elephant Apple), which has a different flavour profile and texture, though both share a hard exterior.
