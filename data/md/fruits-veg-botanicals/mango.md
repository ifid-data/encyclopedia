# Mango

The mango (Mangifera indica), revered as the "King of Fruits," boasts a rich history deeply intertwined with Indian culture. Originating in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, its cultivation dates back over 4,000 years. The English word "mango" is believed to derive from the Tamil "mankay" via Portuguese "manga." Mangoes hold significant cultural and religious importance in India, featuring in ancient texts, art, and festivals. India remains the world's largest producer, with major growing regions spanning Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Thousands of varieties exist, with Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, and Langra being among the most celebrated for their distinct flavour and aroma.

In Indian home kitchens, mangoes are incredibly versatile. Ripe mangoes are savoured fresh, sliced, or blended into refreshing beverages like mango lassi, milkshakes, and 'aamras.' They also feature in desserts, chutneys, and jams. Raw or unripe mangoes, known for their tartness, are indispensable for traditional preparations such as 'aam ka achaar' (mango pickle), tangy chutneys, and as a souring agent in various curries. Dried raw mango, known as 'amchur,' is a staple spice, offering a distinctive sour note to lentil dishes, vegetable preparations, and marinades.

The industrial landscape leverages mango in numerous forms. Pulp, puree, and concentrated forms are foundational ingredients for the beverage industry (juices, nectars, fruit drinks) and dairy products (yogurts, ice creams), as well as confectionery, jams, and fruit bars. Dried mango slices or bits are popular as healthy snacks or additions to trail mixes and breakfast cereals. Mango fruit powder is utilized for flavouring in instant mixes, health supplements, and baked goods. Amchur powder, derived from dried raw mango, is a key component in commercial spice blends, snack seasonings, and ready-to-eat meals, providing a consistent tangy profile. Premium varieties like Alphonso and Kesar are often specifically marketed for high-end processed products.

A common point of confusion arises from the various forms of mango. Consumers often conflate "mango powder" with "amchur" (or "amchoor"). While "mango powder" typically refers to dried ripe mango, used primarily for its sweet, fruity flavour in desserts or beverages, "amchur" is specifically made from dried, unripe (raw) mangoes. Amchur functions as a souring agent, imparting a tart, tangy flavour to savoury dishes, much like lemon or tamarind. The fresh fruit itself, whether ripe or raw, offers a sensory experience distinct from its processed forms like pulp, puree, or juice, each having specific applications.
