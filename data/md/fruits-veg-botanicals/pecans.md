**Pecans**

Pecans (Carya illinoinensis) are a highly prized tree nut native to North America, particularly the southern United States and Mexico. The name "pecan" is derived from the Algonquian word "pacane," referring to a nut that requires a stone to crack. While not indigenous to India, pecans have gained popularity in recent decades through global trade, primarily imported from their native growing regions. They are not cultivated commercially in India, making them a specialty item in the Indian market.

In Indian home kitchens, pecans are primarily embraced in contemporary and Western-inspired culinary applications. They are a popular choice for baking, featuring prominently in desserts such as pecan pies, tarts, brownies, and cookies, where their rich, buttery flavour and tender texture are highly valued. Beyond desserts, pecans are also enjoyed as a nutritious snack, often roasted, candied, or incorporated into breakfast cereals, granolas, and trail mixes, adding a distinct crunch and flavour profile.

Industrially, pecans are utilized in the FMCG sector for premium products. They are a key ingredient in high-end confectionery, gourmet snack mixes, and specialty bakery items like pecan brittle or energy bars. Their robust flavour and nutritional benefits make them suitable for value-added products targeting health-conscious consumers. Pecans are typically processed into whole, halved, or chopped forms, maintaining their natural integrity for various applications without undergoing complex industrial fractionation.

Consumers in India sometimes confuse pecans with walnuts (akhrot) due to their similar appearance as tree nuts. However, pecans are distinct; they are generally more elongated, have a smoother shell, and possess a richer, sweeter, and more buttery flavour compared to the more rugged, often slightly bitter taste of walnuts. While walnuts are widely cultivated and consumed in India, pecans remain a more exotic and gourmet offering, appreciated for their unique taste and texture in specific culinary contexts.
