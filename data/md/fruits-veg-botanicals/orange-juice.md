## Orange Juice

Orange juice, derived from the fruit of the *Citrus sinensis* tree, is a globally popular beverage with a significant presence in India. Oranges themselves trace their origins to Southeast Asia, likely a hybrid of pomelo and mandarin, and were introduced to India centuries ago, flourishing in various climatic zones. In India, oranges are commonly known as *santras* or *narangis*, with Nagpur in Maharashtra being famously dubbed the "Orange City" due to its extensive cultivation. Other major growing regions include Punjab, Rajasthan, and parts of Andhra Pradesh, ensuring a steady supply of fresh fruit that has historically been consumed whole or as a simple, freshly squeezed beverage.

In Indian home kitchens, orange juice is primarily enjoyed as a refreshing drink, particularly during warmer months. Its vibrant flavour and high Vitamin C content make it a popular choice for breakfast or as a revitalising pick-me-up. Beyond direct consumption, it finds occasional use in simple desserts like fruit salads, jellies, or as a flavouring agent in some regional sweet preparations. Its tart-sweet profile also lends itself to marinades for certain meats or in glazes, though these applications are less traditional and more influenced by modern culinary trends.

Industrially, orange juice is a cornerstone of the packaged beverage market. Manufacturers utilise both "Not From Concentrate" (NFC) juice and "from concentrate" forms to produce a wide range of products. Concentrated orange juice, achieved by removing water, offers significant advantages in terms of storage, transportation, and extended shelf-life, making it ideal for large-scale production and distribution. Dehydrated orange juice and tropical juice powders are employed in instant beverage mixes, health supplements, and as natural flavourings in confectionery, snacks, and bakery items, providing a convenient and stable form of the fruit's essence.

A common point of confusion for consumers lies in distinguishing between "freshly squeezed" or "Not From Concentrate" (NFC) orange juice and "orange juice from concentrate." While NFC juice is simply pasteurised and packaged, juice from concentrate involves the removal of water from freshly squeezed juice, followed by re-addition of water before packaging. This processing can subtly alter the flavour profile. Furthermore, these are distinct from "orange-flavoured drinks" or "beverages" (sometimes colloquially referred to as 'ange juice' in a generic sense for synthetic variants), which often contain minimal actual fruit juice, relying instead on artificial flavourings and sweeteners, offering a different sensory experience and nutritional value.
