## Jalapeño

Jalapeño, botanically classified as *Capsicum annuum*, is a medium-sized chili pepper originating from Xalapa (Jalapa), Veracruz, Mexico, from which it derives its name. This pepper has been a cornerstone of Mesoamerican cuisine for millennia. While deeply embedded in Mexican and Tex-Mex culinary traditions worldwide, its presence in India is a relatively modern phenomenon, largely spurred by the global proliferation of international cuisines. Unlike the diverse array of indigenous Indian chillies, jalapeños are not native to the subcontinent. However, with the increasing demand for global flavours, limited commercial cultivation has emerged in specific Indian regions, primarily to cater to niche markets and the burgeoning food processing industry.

In Indian home kitchens, the jalapeño is primarily embraced in contemporary and fusion cooking rather than traditional recipes. Its distinctive moderate heat, crisp texture, and fresh, grassy undertones make it a popular ingredient in dishes like pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. Most commonly, it is incorporated in its pickled form, lending a tangy and spicy zest. While not a staple in classic Indian curries or dals, finely chopped fresh or pickled jalapeños can be found in modern Indian snacks, innovative dips, or as a vibrant garnish, offering a unique piquant element that complements a wide range of flavours without overwhelming them.

Industrially, jalapeños are extensively processed and utilized, predominantly in their pickled state—sliced, diced, or whole. This makes them a ubiquitous component in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, particularly in ready-to-eat meals, frozen pizzas, burger patties, and a variety of sauces, salsas, and dips. Beyond pickling, jalapeños are also dried and ground into powders or extracted as oleoresins. These concentrated forms serve as flavouring agents in snack foods, spice blends, and seasonings, providing a consistent heat and flavour profile essential for large-scale food production. Their robust flavour and texture are well-suited for mass-produced items requiring a distinct spicy and tangy note.

Consumers in India often encounter jalapeños in their pickled form, which can lead to confusion with other green chillies or even bell peppers (capsicum). While both jalapeños and many Indian green chillies belong to the *Capsicum annuum* species, jalapeños are typically characterized by their thicker flesh, a more pronounced vegetal flavour, and a moderate heat level (2,500-8,000 Scoville Heat Units). This contrasts with the often sharper, thinner-skinned, and frequently more intensely hot local Indian varieties. Furthermore, jalapeños are distinct from bell peppers, which are much larger, entirely mild, and lack the characteristic pungency and heat that define a jalapeño.
