**Cherries**

Cherries, primarily derived from species like *Prunus avium* (sweet cherry) and *Prunus cerasus* (sour cherry), trace their origins to regions spanning from Anatolia to the Caucasus mountains. While not indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, their cultivation was introduced and has flourished in the cooler, temperate climes of India's northern states. Major growing regions include Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, where specific varieties have adapted well to the local conditions. The English term "cherry" itself is derived from the Old North French "cherise," ultimately tracing back to the Greek "kerasos," reflecting its ancient cultivation history.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh cherries are primarily enjoyed as a seasonal fruit, prized for their sweet-tart flavour and vibrant colour. They are often consumed raw, added to fruit salads, or used as a garnish for desserts. While not a staple in traditional Indian savoury cooking, their adoption into modern Indian culinary practices sees them incorporated into jams, preserves, compotes, and as a decorative element for cakes, pastries, and ice creams, particularly during their short harvest season.

Industrially, cherries find extensive application in the FMCG sector, often in processed forms to ensure year-round availability and functional utility. Canned cherries (P-CAN), typically pitted and packed in syrup, are widely used in bakeries for pies, tarts, and fillings, as well as in confectionery and ready-to-eat fruit preparations. Cherry juice concentrate (F-CONCENTRATE, M-JUICE, P-CAN) is a significant ingredient, valued for its intense flavour, natural colour, and sweetness. It is a key component in beverages like fruit juices, sodas, and health drinks, and also features in yogurts, sauces, and various dessert formulations, offering a convenient and shelf-stable cherry essence.

Consumers often encounter cherries in various forms, leading to some distinction. Fresh cherries are seasonal and delicate, best enjoyed raw or with minimal processing. Canned cherries, while convenient and shelf-stable, are typically sweetened and have a softer texture, making them suitable for cooked applications. Cherry juice concentrate, on the other hand, is a highly processed product, where water is removed to create a potent, concentrated liquid primarily used for flavouring and colouring in industrial food and beverage manufacturing, rather than as a direct fruit substitute.
