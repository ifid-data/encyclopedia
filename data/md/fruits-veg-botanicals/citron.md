**Citron**

The citron (Citrus medica) is one of the original citrus fruits from which all other cultivated citrus species are believed to have evolved through natural hybridization. Native to Southeast Asia and India, its presence in the subcontinent dates back millennia, with mentions in ancient Sanskrit texts as "matulunga." It holds significant cultural and religious importance, often used in rituals and as an offering. In India, it is primarily cultivated in the southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where specific varieties thrive, and also in parts of Northeast India. Its robust nature and adaptability to diverse climates have allowed it to maintain its ancient lineage across various regions.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, the citron is prized more for its thick, aromatic rind than its pulp. It is a cornerstone ingredient in various pickles (achaar), particularly in South India, where it is known as "narthangai." The fruit's zest and candied peel are also used in preserves (murabba) and traditional sweets, offering a unique bitter-sweet, fragrant note. Beyond culinary applications, citron has a long history in Ayurvedic medicine, valued for its digestive properties, ability to alleviate nausea, and as a general tonic, often consumed as a decoction or infused preparation.

Industrially, citron finds its niche primarily in the production of candied peel, a key ingredient in bakery products like fruit cakes, panettone, and various confectionery items globally. Its thick albedo (the white pith) is an excellent source of pectin, a natural gelling agent used in jams, jellies, and other food products. Essential oils extracted from the rind are utilized in the flavouring industry for beverages and sweets, as well as in perfumery and aromatherapy, owing to its distinct, complex citrus aroma. However, its direct application in mainstream Indian FMCG products remains limited compared to more common citrus fruits.

Consumers often confuse citron with larger lemons or limes due to their shared citrus family resemblance. However, citron is distinctly characterized by its unusually thick, bumpy rind, minimal juice content, and a less intensely sour, often slightly bitter pulp. Unlike lemons or limes, which are primarily valued for their juice, the citron's culinary and industrial utility lies predominantly in its aromatic zest and substantial rind. It is also distinct from other citrus fruits like pomelo, which, while large, possesses a much juicier, segmented pulp.
