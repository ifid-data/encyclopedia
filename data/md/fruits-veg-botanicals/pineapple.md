### Pineapple

Pineapple, scientifically known as *Ananas comosus*, is a tropical fruit with a rich history and significant presence in global and Indian culinary landscapes. Originating in South America, specifically the region between southern Brazil and Paraguay, it was introduced to India by Portuguese explorers in the 16th century. The name "pineapple" was coined by Europeans due to its resemblance to a pinecone, while its indigenous name "Ananas" (from the Tupi-Guarani word *nana*, meaning "excellent fruit") is widely used in many languages, including several Indian vernaculars. Today, India is a major producer, with significant cultivation in the North-eastern states like Assam, Tripura, and Meghalaya, as well as West Bengal, Kerala, and Karnataka, thriving in the humid tropical climate.

In Indian home kitchens, pineapple is cherished for its sweet-tart flavour and juicy texture. It is commonly enjoyed fresh, sliced, or diced in fruit salads and as a refreshing snack. Its versatility extends to traditional preparations, featuring prominently in Bengali *chutneys* (like *anarosh-er chutney*), South Indian curries (such as Kerala's *pineapple pachadi* or *pulissery*), and various *raitas*. The fruit's natural enzymes, particularly bromelain, make it an excellent tenderizer for meats in marinades, a technique occasionally employed in regional non-vegetarian dishes. It is also blended into refreshing juices, smoothies, and incorporated into desserts like *halwa* or fruit-based custards.

Industrially, pineapple is a cornerstone ingredient in the FMCG sector. Its processed forms, including canned slices, chunks, and crushed pineapple (P-CAN), are widely used in bakeries for cakes, pastries, and tarts, and in the hospitality sector for desserts and garnishes. Pineapple juice (M-JUICE) and its concentrated form (F-CONCENTRATE) are fundamental to the beverage industry, forming the base for numerous fruit drinks, squashes, and cocktails. Pineapple pulp (M-PULP) and various fruit preparations are essential for yogurts, ice creams, jams, and fruit fillings, providing consistent flavour and texture. Beyond food, bromelain is extracted for pharmaceutical applications and as a natural meat tenderizer.

Consumers often encounter pineapple in various forms, leading to some functional distinctions. Fresh pineapple offers a vibrant, tangy flavour and active bromelain enzymes, making it ideal for raw consumption and marinades. Canned pineapple, typically packed in syrup, is sweeter and softer, making it convenient for desserts and cooked applications where enzyme activity is not desired. Pineapple juice and concentrate provide a convenient liquid form for beverages, while pulp and fruit preparations offer a consistent base for processed foods. It is important to recognize these different forms are tailored for specific culinary and industrial applications, each contributing uniquely to the final product.
