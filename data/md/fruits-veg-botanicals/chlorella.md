### Chlorella

Chlorella is a genus of single-celled green algae, a microscopic organism that thrives in freshwater. Discovered in the late 19th century by Dutch microbiologist M.W. Beijerinck, Chlorella is not indigenous to India's traditional culinary or medicinal heritage. Its introduction to the Indian market is a relatively recent phenomenon, driven by global health and wellness trends. Primarily cultivated in controlled aquaculture environments, such as large ponds or bioreactors, to ensure purity and prevent contamination, Chlorella is a highly efficient photosynthesizer, known for its rapid growth and exceptionally high chlorophyll content.

In Indian home kitchens, Chlorella holds no traditional culinary significance. It is not used in tempering, frying, or as a staple ingredient in any regional cuisine. Instead, its presence is almost exclusively as a dietary supplement. Modern health-conscious Indian households might incorporate Chlorella powder into smoothies, juices, or sprinkle it over yogurt and salads, seeking its purported nutritional benefits. It is typically consumed in small quantities, reflecting its role as a functional food rather than a primary ingredient.

Industrially, Chlorella is a prominent ingredient within the global nutraceutical and functional food sectors, a trend that has extended to India. It is widely processed into tablets, capsules, and powders for dietary supplements, valued for its rich profile of protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins), minerals, antioxidants, and unique Chlorella Growth Factor (CGF). Its detoxifying properties, particularly its ability to bind to heavy metals, make it a popular component in 'cleanse' and 'detox' products. Beyond supplements, Chlorella's vibrant green pigment also finds application as a natural food colouring in various processed foods and beverages.

Consumers often encounter Chlorella alongside other 'superfood' microalgae, leading to common confusion, particularly with Spirulina. While both are green microalgae celebrated for their nutritional density, they are distinct. Chlorella is a true green algae with a tough, indigestible cell wall that requires processing (e.g., 'cracked cell wall' Chlorella) to make its nutrients bioavailable. Spirulina, conversely, is a cyanobacterium (often called blue-green algae) with a softer cell wall, making it more readily digestible. Chlorella is particularly noted for its high chlorophyll content and CGF, whereas Spirulina is often recognized for its higher protein content and the presence of phycocyanin.
