**Almonds**

Almonds, known colloquially as *Badam* across India, derive their name from the Old French *almande*, itself from the Latin *amygdala*, reflecting their ancient origins in Central Asia and the Middle East. Though not extensively cultivated in India, almonds have been a prized dry fruit for millennia, introduced through ancient trade routes and further popularized during the Mughal era, becoming integral to royal and festive cuisines. Today, India is a significant importer, with the majority sourced from California and Australia, making them a staple in Indian households and a symbol of prosperity and health.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, almonds are revered for their versatility and nutritional value. They are commonly consumed raw or soaked overnight, often peeled, as a morning health tonic. Their rich, buttery texture and subtle sweetness make them a popular addition to an array of sweets (*mithai*) such as *Badam Halwa*, *Badam Katli*, and *Kheer*. In savory preparations, especially in North Indian and Mughlai cuisines, blanched and ground almonds are used to thicken gravies for *kormas* and *biryanis*, imparting a luxurious creaminess and delicate flavor. They are also a key ingredient in refreshing beverages like *Badam Doodh* (almond milk), served both hot and cold.

The industrial landscape sees almonds utilized in various functional forms. Almond flour, a gluten-free alternative, is increasingly popular in health-conscious baking and confectionery, used in everything from cookies to macarons. Almond paste finds application in marzipan, cake fillings, and other gourmet desserts. Almond pieces and slivers are widely incorporated into breakfast cereals, energy bars, chocolates, and ice creams, adding texture and nutritional value. Roasted almonds, with their enhanced aroma and crunch, are a popular snack item and a component of trail mixes and savory snack formulations. Almond butter is also gaining traction as a healthy spread in the FMCG sector.

Consumers often encounter almonds in various forms, leading to some internal distinctions. While "almonds" generally refers to the whole nut, products like "almond flour" or "almond paste" represent processed derivatives, each with distinct culinary applications. Almond flour, made from finely ground blanched almonds, is primarily a baking ingredient, whereas almond paste, a blend of ground almonds and sugar, is used for confectionery and fillings. The term *Badam* in India universally refers to almonds, distinguishing them from other nuts like cashews or pistachios, which have their own unique flavor profiles and uses.
