# Pumpkin

Pumpkin, known widely as *kaddu* in Hindi and by various regional names such as *kumbalakai* (Kannada) or *gummadikaya* (Telugu), is a versatile fruit botanically classified as a berry, belonging to the *Cucurbita* genus. Originating in the Americas, pumpkins were introduced to India through the Columbian Exchange and have since become deeply integrated into the subcontinent's agricultural and culinary landscape. They are widely cultivated across India, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates, with significant production in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal, where they are a staple crop.

In Indian home kitchens, pumpkin is celebrated for its mild, earthy sweetness and adaptability. The most common varieties, often referred to as "yellow pumpkin," are extensively used in both savoury and sweet preparations. It forms the base for numerous *sabzis* (vegetable dishes), ranging from dry stir-fries to rich gravies, often tempered with mustard seeds, fenugreek, and asafoetida. It is a popular ingredient in South Indian curries like *sambar* and *avial*, and its tender flesh is also transformed into delectable desserts such as *kaddu ka halwa*, a sweet pudding often flavoured with cardamom and nuts. The seeds are also roasted and consumed as a nutritious snack.

Industrially, pumpkin finds applications in various FMCG products. Its pureed form is a common ingredient in baby foods, soups, and health drinks due to its nutritional profile. Pumpkin seeds are processed into snack mixes, granola bars, and cold-pressed oils, which are valued in the nutraceutical and gourmet food sectors for their healthy fats and antioxidants. The pulp is also utilized in baked goods like muffins and breads, contributing moisture and a subtle flavour.

A common point of confusion in India arises from the broad application of the term "pumpkin" to various gourds. While "yellow pumpkin" typically refers to varieties of *Cucurbita moschata* or *Cucurbita maxima*, the term "winter melon pumpkin" often alludes to *Benincasa hispida*, commonly known as ash gourd or *petha*. Though botanically distinct, ash gourd is sometimes colloquially grouped with pumpkins, especially in North India where it is famously used to make the translucent sweet *petha*. It is crucial to distinguish between these, as true pumpkins offer a sweeter, denser flesh, while ash gourd is milder and more watery, lending itself to different culinary outcomes.
