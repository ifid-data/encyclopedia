The guava, scientifically *Psidium guajava*, is a tropical fruit believed to have originated in Central or South America. It was introduced to India by the Portuguese in the 16th century and quickly adapted to the subcontinent's diverse climates. Known as 'Amrood' in Hindi, 'Peru' in Marathi, 'Koyya' in Tamil, and 'Jaam' in Bengali, it has become an integral part of Indian horticulture and cuisine. Major guava-producing states in India include Uttar Pradesh (particularly the Allahabad region, famed for its specific varieties), Bihar, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab, where it thrives in subtropical conditions.

In Indian homes, guava is cherished for its sweet, tangy, and often musky flavour. It is most commonly enjoyed fresh, often sprinkled with a mix of salt and chilli powder, a popular street food snack. Traditionally, guavas are transformed into a variety of preserves, including jams, jellies, and the dense, sweet 'guava cheese' (peru barfi). Its pulp is also used to make refreshing juices, nectars, and sometimes incorporated into chutneys or even certain savoury preparations, though less common.

The versatility of guava makes it a staple in the Indian food processing industry. Guava juice, pulp, and puree are extensively used in FMCG products. Guava juice (M-JUICE) is a popular beverage, often blended with other fruit juices. Guava pulp (M-PULP) serves as a base for a wide array of products, from jams and jellies to fruit-based yogurts and baby foods, providing texture and flavour. Guava puree (M-PUREE) offers a smoother consistency, ideal for nectars, sauces, and desserts. Furthermore, guava puree concentrate (F-CONCENTRATE + M-PUREE) is a crucial industrial ingredient, allowing for efficient storage and transport, later reconstituted for various applications in beverages, confectionery, and dairy.

While the fresh fruit is widely recognized, consumers sometimes conflate the various processed forms of guava. "Guava juice" typically refers to a diluted beverage, often with added sugar, while "guava nectar" usually denotes a product with a higher fruit content and a thicker consistency. Guava pulp and puree, though similar, differ in their fibrous content and smoothness, making them suitable for distinct industrial applications. It's also worth noting the difference between white-fleshed and pink-fleshed guavas, with the latter often preferred for its vibrant colour and distinct aroma in processed products.
