The peach (scientific name: *Prunus persica*) is a deciduous stone fruit native to the region of Northwest China, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. Its journey to India, likely via ancient trade routes through Persia (from which its Latin name *persica* is derived), established it as a cherished temperate fruit. In India, peaches are primarily cultivated in the cooler, hilly regions, with Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and parts of Jammu & Kashmir being the leading producers. The fruit thrives in climates with distinct cold winters and warm summers, making these northern states ideal for its growth.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh peaches are enjoyed seasonally as a refreshing fruit, often eaten out of hand or incorporated into simple desserts. While not traditionally central to classical Indian cuisine in the way mangoes or guavas are, modern culinary trends see peaches used in fruit salads, smoothies, and homemade jams or preserves. Their sweet, juicy flesh with a characteristic fuzzy skin (though some varieties are smooth, known as nectarines) offers a delightful balance of sweetness and a subtle tartness, making them a versatile ingredient for contemporary Indian palates.

Industrially, peaches find extensive application in the FMCG sector, particularly in the production of beverages and processed foods. Peach juice, often available in canned or tetra-pack formats, is a popular offering, valued for its distinct flavour and aroma. Peach pulp, also frequently canned, serves as a base for nectars, fruit yogurts, ice creams, and various dessert fillings. The canning process (P-CAN) allows for the fruit's flavour and nutritional value to be preserved, making peaches accessible year-round, far beyond their relatively short fresh season, and enabling their widespread use in packaged goods across the country.

Consumers often encounter peaches in various forms, leading to some confusion between the fresh fruit and its processed derivatives. While fresh peaches are a seasonal delight, offering a unique texture and vibrant flavour, peach juice and peach pulp represent concentrated or diluted forms of the fruit, designed for convenience and extended shelf life. It is important to distinguish between the whole fruit and these processed forms, as their applications and nutritional profiles can vary. The availability of canned peach juice and pulp ensures that the distinctive taste of peach can be enjoyed even when the fresh fruit is out of season.
