# Dry Fruit

Dry fruit, often referred to as "mewa" in many parts of India, represents a category of fruits from which the majority of the original water content has been removed either naturally, through sun drying, or by using specialized dehydrators. This ancient preservation technique dates back millennia, with evidence of dried fruits like dates and figs being consumed in early civilizations. In India, dry fruits hold significant cultural and traditional value, frequently featuring in religious offerings, festive celebrations like Diwali and Eid, and as a symbol of hospitality. Major dry fruits consumed in India include raisins (kishmish), dates (khajoor), figs (anjeer), and apricots (khubani), with a substantial portion being imported, though some varieties like raisins are also produced domestically.

In Indian home kitchens, dry fruits are cherished for their concentrated flavour, natural sweetness, and nutritional density. They are commonly consumed as a healthy snack on their own or as part of a trail mix. Their culinary versatility shines in traditional sweets and desserts such as kheer, halwa, and barfi, where they add texture and richness. Dry fruits also find their way into savoury preparations, particularly in Mughlai and Kashmiri cuisines, enhancing biryanis, pulaos, and rich curries. Soaked overnight, certain dry fruits like figs and dates are traditionally consumed for their purported digestive and energy-boosting properties.

The industrial food sector extensively utilizes dry fruits for their functional properties and consumer appeal. They are a staple ingredient in breakfast cereals, granola bars, energy bars, and various bakery products like fruit cakes, cookies, and breads, providing natural sweetness, chewiness, and fiber. In the confectionery industry, they are incorporated into chocolates and candies. Furthermore, dry fruits serve as natural sweeteners and texturizers in dairy products such as yogurts and ice creams, and as inclusions in ready-to-eat snack mixes, catering to the growing demand for convenient and wholesome food options.

A common point of confusion in the Indian context arises from the broad term "dry fruit" itself. Consumers often conflate naturally dehydrated fruits (like raisins or dried apricots) with "candied fruits" (such as tutti-frutti or glazed cherries), which are preserved in sugar syrup and have a significantly different nutritional profile. Additionally, in common parlance, "dry fruits" are frequently grouped with "nuts" (like almonds, cashews, walnuts) under the collective term "dry fruits and nuts," despite nuts being botanically distinct seeds or fruits with a hard shell, rather than dehydrated fleshy fruits.
