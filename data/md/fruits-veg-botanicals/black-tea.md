**Black Tea**

Black tea, known colloquially as *chai* across India, is a fully oxidized tea derived from the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant. While tea originated in China, its widespread cultivation and consumption in India were largely a legacy of British colonial efforts in the 19th century, aimed at breaking China's monopoly. Today, India stands as one of the world's largest producers and consumers of black tea, with iconic regions like Assam, Darjeeling, and the Nilgiris being globally renowned for their distinct varieties. Assam tea is celebrated for its robust, malty flavour, Darjeeling for its delicate muscatel notes, and Nilgiri for its bright, brisk character, each reflecting the unique terroir of its origin.

In Indian homes, black tea is an indispensable part of daily life, often consumed multiple times a day. Its most ubiquitous form is *masala chai*, a comforting brew prepared by simmering black tea leaves with milk, sugar, and a blend of aromatic spices such as ginger, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Beyond this, it is enjoyed plain, with lemon, or as a refreshing iced beverage. The ritual of preparing and sharing tea is deeply ingrained in Indian culture, symbolizing hospitality, conversation, and a moment of pause.

Industrially, black tea is a cornerstone of the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. It is processed into various grades, primarily CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) for strong, quick-brewing teas commonly found in tea bags and instant tea powders, and Orthodox for more nuanced, whole-leaf infusions. These forms are extensively used in ready-to-drink beverages, as flavouring agents in confectionery, baked goods, and even some savoury snacks. India's vast tea industry also makes black tea a significant export commodity, contributing substantially to the national economy.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the various types of tea. Black tea is fundamentally distinguished from green tea and oolong tea by its complete oxidation process, which gives it its characteristic dark colour and robust flavour profile. Green tea, in contrast, is unoxidized, retaining a lighter colour and grassy notes, while oolong is partially oxidized, falling between the two. Furthermore, regional designations like "Assam black tea" or "Darjeeling black tea" refer to specific varieties of black tea, each possessing unique sensory attributes, rather than entirely different categories of tea.
