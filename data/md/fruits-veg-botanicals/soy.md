Soy (Glycine max), commonly known as soybean or soya bean, originated in East Asia, particularly China, where it has been cultivated for millennia. Its introduction to India is relatively recent, gaining prominence in the latter half of the 20th century, primarily as a high-protein crop and source of edible oil. The term "soy" is believed to derive from Japanese "shoyu" or Chinese "shíyòu," though in India, it's widely known as "soyabean." Major cultivation regions include Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, making India a significant producer in the global oilseed and protein meal economy.

While not historically integral to traditional Indian home cooking, soy has found a firm footing in modern Indian kitchens, especially among vegetarian and health-conscious households. Whole soy beans are sometimes roasted as "soy nuts" for snacking. More commonly, processed forms like "soya chunks" or "soya granules" (Texturized Vegetable Protein, TVP) are widely used as a versatile meat substitute in curries, pulaos, and stir-fries, valued for their protein content and ability to absorb flavours. Soya milk and tofu (often seen as a paneer alternative) have also become popular.

In the industrial food sector, soy is a cornerstone ingredient, particularly its defatted forms. After oil extraction, the remaining "defatted soy" meal is processed into "soya flour," "soya flakes," or "soya granules." These are extensively used in the FMCG industry as protein fortifiers in baked goods, breakfast cereals, and snack foods. "Soya bean extract" is the base for soya milk, which is further processed into tofu, tempeh, and various dairy alternatives. Soy protein isolates and concentrates, derived from defatted soy, are critical components in protein supplements, nutritional beverages, and infant formulas, owing to their high biological value and functional properties like emulsification and water binding.

A common point of confusion arises from the various forms of soy. Consumers often conflate "soy" or "soyabean" (referring to the whole bean) with its processed derivatives, particularly "defatted soy" products. Whole soy beans are primarily used for making milk, tofu, or roasted snacks. In contrast, "defatted soya flour," "soya granules," and "soya flakes" are the by-products of oil extraction, resulting in a high-protein, low-fat ingredient. This distinction is crucial for understanding their nutritional profiles and diverse applications, as defatted forms are primarily valued for their protein content and functional properties rather than their fat.
