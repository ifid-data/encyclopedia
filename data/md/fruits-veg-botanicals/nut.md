**Nut**

Nuts, botanically defined as dry fruits with a hard shell enclosing a single seed, have been an integral part of human diets for millennia, prized for their concentrated nutrition and energy. In India, the consumption and cultural significance of nuts trace back to ancient times, with indigenous varieties like walnuts (अखरोट, *akhrot*) and some wild almonds being historically gathered. The introduction and widespread cultivation of other popular nuts, such as cashews (काजू, *kaju*) and almonds (बादाम, *badam*), were largely influenced by trade routes and colonial introductions, particularly the Portuguese bringing cashews to Goa in the 16th century. Today, while some nuts like cashews are extensively cultivated in coastal regions (e.g., Kerala, Karnataka, Goa), many, including almonds, pistachios (पिस्ता, *pista*), and walnuts, are also significant imports, reflecting their global demand and diverse sourcing.

In Indian home kitchens, nuts are celebrated for their versatility, texture, and flavour. They are a cornerstone of traditional sweets (*mithai*), lending richness and body to preparations like *barfi*, *halwa*, and *ladoo*, often ground into pastes or finely chopped. In savoury dishes, especially in Mughlai and North Indian cuisines, cashew and almond pastes are frequently used as thickening agents for gravies, imparting a creamy texture and subtle sweetness to curries like *korma* and *shahi paneer*. Whole or chopped nuts serve as garnishes for biryanis, pulaos, and desserts, while roasted nuts are popular as standalone snacks or as additions to *namkeen* mixes, providing a satisfying crunch and nutritional boost.

The industrial food sector leverages nuts extensively for their functional and nutritional properties. Nut pieces (M-BITS) are particularly valuable in the FMCG landscape, finding their way into a vast array of products. They are a staple in breakfast cereals, granola bars, energy bars, and trail mixes, contributing texture, protein, and healthy fats. In confectionery, nut pieces are incorporated into chocolates, cookies, and ice creams. Beyond whole or chopped forms, nuts are processed into flours for gluten-free baking, and into butters and spreads, offering alternative protein and fat sources for a health-conscious market. Their natural oils are also extracted for use in various food applications and even cosmetics.

A common point of confusion surrounding "nut" in the Indian culinary context stems from the divergence between botanical and common usage. Botanically, a true nut is a specific type of dry fruit. However, culinarily, the term "nut" is often applied more broadly to any large, oily kernel found within a shell and used in cooking. This leads to the frequent classification of peanuts (मूंगफली, *moongphali*), which are botanically legumes, and coconuts (नारियल, *nariyal*), which are drupes, as nuts in everyday language and cooking. This distinction is important for those with allergies, as the allergenic proteins in true nuts, legumes, and drupes can differ, despite their similar culinary roles.
