**Hadjod**

Hadjod, scientifically known as *Cissus quadrangularis*, is a revered perennial plant deeply rooted in India's traditional medicinal systems, particularly Ayurveda. Its Sanskrit name, 'Asthisamharaka', literally translates to "that which protects bones from destruction" or "bone setter," underscoring its ancient reputation for promoting bone health and aiding fracture healing. Native to India and Sri Lanka, this succulent vine thrives in arid regions and is also found across Africa and Southeast Asia. Historically, it has been revered for its therapeutic properties, with mentions in classical Ayurvedic texts. While traditionally wild-harvested, its increasing demand in wellness industries has led to more structured cultivation, particularly in states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Though primarily recognized for its medicinal value, Hadjod also finds limited, yet significant, culinary applications in certain regional Indian cuisines. The young, tender stems and leaves are occasionally incorporated into dishes, particularly in parts of South India. Its slightly sour, pungent, and astringent taste lends itself to chutneys, *thogayals* (thick chutneys), and even some curries, where it is often cooked to mitigate its raw tartness and reduce oxalic acid content. It is not a staple vegetable but rather a seasonal or specialty ingredient, valued for its perceived health benefits even in culinary contexts.

In modern industry, Hadjod is predominantly utilized in the nutraceutical and dietary supplement sectors. The "hadjod extract" (F-EXTRACT) is a concentrated form, standardized to contain specific bioactive compounds, primarily ketosterones, which are believed to be responsible for its osteogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. These extracts are formulated into capsules, tablets, powders, and even topical applications aimed at supporting bone density, aiding fracture recovery, and alleviating joint pain. Its growing popularity stems from a global interest in natural remedies for musculoskeletal health, making it a key ingredient in many bone and joint support supplements.

A common point of confusion arises between the fresh Hadjod plant or its raw stem and its industrial "extract." While the fresh plant is occasionally used in traditional home cooking or folk remedies, the "hadjod extract" represents a highly processed and concentrated form. The extract is specifically engineered to deliver a standardized dose of active compounds like ketosterones, ensuring consistent therapeutic efficacy, which is difficult to achieve with the variable potency of the raw plant. This distinction is crucial for consumers seeking specific health benefits, as the extract offers a more potent and measurable approach compared to the whole botanical.
