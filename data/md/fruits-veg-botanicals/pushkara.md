**Pushkara**

Pushkara, botanically known as *Inula racemosa*, is a revered medicinal herb in India, primarily valued for its aromatic and therapeutic root. Known in Sanskrit as Pushkara or Pushkarmool, its name, while sharing a linguistic root with the sacred lotus or a holy pond, specifically refers to this distinct plant in the context of traditional medicine. Native to the Himalayan regions and parts of North India, particularly Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, it thrives in temperate climates. Its historical significance is deeply embedded in Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, where it is extensively documented for its efficacy in treating respiratory and cardiac conditions, establishing its heritage as a cornerstone of traditional Indian pharmacopoeia.

In home and traditional settings, Pushkara is not typically used as a culinary spice but rather as a potent herbal remedy. The dried root, characterized by its pungent and bitter taste, is most commonly prepared as a decoction (kadha) or a fine powder (churna). It is a popular ingredient in homemade remedies for coughs, colds, asthma, and bronchitis, often combined with other respiratory herbs like Vasa (Adhatoda vasica) or Pippali (Long Pepper). Its warming properties are believed to alleviate Kapha and Vata imbalances, making it a staple during colder months or for individuals prone to respiratory congestion.

The industrial and modern applications of Pushkara are predominantly within the Ayurvedic and herbal pharmaceutical sectors. Manufacturers utilize standardized extracts and powders of *Inula racemosa* root in a range of formulations, including cough syrups, respiratory tonics, immune-boosting supplements, and cardiovascular support products. Its active compounds, such as alantolactone and isoalantolactone, are researched for their bronchodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties, leading to its inclusion in various nutraceuticals and herbal medicines aimed at promoting lung health and overall well-being.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding "Pushkara" due to its shared name with the sacred Pushkar lotus or the holy Pushkar lake. However, in the context of herbal medicine, Pushkara unequivocally refers to the root of *Inula racemosa*, a distinct plant with unique therapeutic properties. It is also important to distinguish it from other Ayurvedic herbs used for respiratory ailments; while many herbs address coughs, Pushkara is particularly noted for its specific action in clearing bronchial passages, strengthening lung function, and offering cardiac support, setting it apart from general expectorants or anti-tussives.
