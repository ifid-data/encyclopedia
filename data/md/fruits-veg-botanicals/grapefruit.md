The grapefruit (*Citrus paradisi*) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its large, round, semi-sweet to bitter fruit. Originating in Barbados in the 18th century as a hybrid of pomelo and sweet orange, it was later introduced to other parts of the world, including India, though it is not indigenous. In India, its cultivation is limited, primarily found in niche horticultural pockets in states like Maharashtra, Punjab, and parts of South India, often for local consumption or specific markets. The name "grapefruit" is attributed to its tendency to grow in clusters, similar to grapes.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh grapefruit is primarily consumed as a breakfast fruit, often segmented and eaten raw, or juiced for its refreshing, albeit distinctively bitter, flavour. Unlike other citrus fruits like oranges or limes, grapefruit has not historically been integrated into traditional Indian culinary practices due to its unique bitter notes, which differ significantly from the sourness preferred in many regional dishes. However, with increasing global exposure, it finds its way into modern salads, detox drinks, and contemporary beverage preparations.

Industrially, grapefruit is most commonly processed into **grapefruit juice concentrate**. This concentrated form, achieved by removing water from the fresh juice, is highly valued for its extended shelf life, reduced transportation costs, and consistent flavour profile, making it a staple ingredient in the beverage industry. It is widely used in the production of packaged juices, soft drinks, health beverages, and as a flavouring agent in candies, jellies, and certain pharmaceutical preparations. The concentrate allows manufacturers to incorporate grapefruit's characteristic tangy and slightly bitter notes into a variety of products year-round.

A common point of confusion arises between the fresh grapefruit and its processed form, **grapefruit juice concentrate**. While fresh grapefruit is the whole fruit, consumed directly for its fibrous texture and complex bitter-sweet taste, the concentrate is a highly processed ingredient where water has been largely removed, resulting in a more intense flavour and a much longer shelf life. Consumers might not always distinguish between products made from fresh juice versus concentrate, or they may confuse its unique bitter profile with other, sweeter citrus varieties like oranges or sweet limes, which are more prevalent in the Indian diet.
