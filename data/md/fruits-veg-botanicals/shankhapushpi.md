# Shankhapushpi

Shankhapushpi, a revered herb in Ayurvedic medicine, derives its name from Sanskrit, where "shankha" refers to a conch shell and "pushpi" to a flower, alluding to its distinctive conch-shaped blossoms. Historically, it has been documented in ancient Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita for its profound impact on cognitive function and mental well-being. While often associated with *Convolvulus pluricaulis*, the term Shankhapushpi is colloquially applied to several botanicals, including *Evolvulus alsinoides* and sometimes *Clitoria ternatea* (Butterfly Pea), leading to some botanical ambiguity. This perennial herb typically thrives in the plains and dry, rocky areas across India, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, where it is traditionally wild-harvested or cultivated for medicinal purposes.

Unlike many Indian botanicals that find their way into daily cooking, Shankhapushpi's primary role is therapeutic rather than culinary. In traditional Indian homes, it is not used as a spice or vegetable but rather as a medicinal preparation. It is commonly consumed as a churna (powder) mixed with honey or ghee, or brewed into a decoction (kadha) to support memory, reduce stress, and promote restful sleep. Its mild, slightly bitter taste means it is rarely incorporated into everyday dishes, but rather taken specifically for its health benefits, often as part of a daily wellness regimen prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners.

In modern industrial applications, Shankhapushpi is a prominent ingredient in the burgeoning nutraceutical and herbal supplement markets. Its adaptogenic and nootropic properties make it a key component in formulations aimed at enhancing cognitive function, reducing anxiety, and improving mental clarity. Shankhapushpi extract is particularly valued in this sector. These standardized extracts ensure consistent potency of active compounds like alkaloids (e.g., shankhapushpine) and flavonoids, allowing for precise dosing in capsules, tablets, and syrups. It is widely used in Ayurvedic proprietary medicines, health drinks, and brain tonics, catering to a growing consumer demand for natural cognitive enhancers and stress-relief solutions.

A significant point of confusion surrounding Shankhapushpi lies in its botanical identity. While *Convolvulus pluricaulis* is often considered the authentic source in many Ayurvedic traditions, *Evolvulus alsinoides* is also widely accepted and used under the same common name, and occasionally *Clitoria ternatea* is misidentified. Each plant possesses distinct phytochemical profiles, leading to variations in therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, consumers often encounter Shankhapushpi in various forms: as a raw herb, a dried powder, or as a concentrated extract. The extract, while derived from the whole herb, is a processed form designed for higher potency and standardization of specific active compounds, differing from the traditional whole herb powder used in home remedies.
