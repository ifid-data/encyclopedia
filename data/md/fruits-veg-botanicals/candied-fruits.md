Candied fruits represent an ancient method of fruit preservation, originating in the Middle East and later refined in Europe, particularly Italy, before making their way to India. The process involves saturating fruit pieces in sugar syrup, which replaces the water content, thereby inhibiting microbial growth and extending shelf life. In India, while a variety of fruits can be candied, the term "tutti frutti" (Italian for "all fruits") has become synonymous with small, brightly coloured cubes, predominantly made from raw papaya due to its neutral flavour and firm texture, allowing it to absorb colours and flavours effectively. These are often sourced from regions with abundant papaya cultivation.

In Indian home kitchens, candied fruits, especially the tutti frutti variety, are cherished for their vibrant colours and chewy sweetness. They are a popular inclusion in traditional baked goods like fruit cakes, plum cakes, and muffins, adding bursts of flavour and visual appeal. Beyond baking, they are frequently used as a garnish or ingredient in desserts such as kulfi, falooda, ice creams, and various puddings, lending a festive touch and textural contrast. Their sweet, slightly chewy nature makes them a delightful addition to festive preparations and everyday treats alike.

The industrial application of candied fruits, particularly tutti frutti, is extensive within the Indian FMCG sector. They are a staple ingredient in commercial bakeries for mass-produced cakes, biscuits, and cookies, providing consistent flavour and texture. In the dairy industry, they are incorporated into ice creams, yogurts, and milkshakes. Confectionery manufacturers use them in chocolates, candies, and sweet mixes. The stability offered by the candying process makes them ideal for long shelf-life products, while their vibrant colours enhance product aesthetics, making them a cost-effective and versatile ingredient for a wide range of processed foods.

A common point of confusion arises between the general term "candied fruits" and the specific "tutti frutti." While "candied fruits" can refer to any fruit preserved in sugar, often in larger pieces (e.g., candied orange peel, cherries), "tutti frutti" in the Indian context almost exclusively denotes the small, multi-coloured, diced pieces, typically made from papaya. These are distinct from simply "dried fruits," which are dehydrated without the extensive sugar impregnation, and thus lack the characteristic glossy, chewy texture and intense sweetness of candied varieties. The terms "tooty fruity" and "tutti frutti" are used interchangeably to describe this specific mixed, diced, and coloured product.
