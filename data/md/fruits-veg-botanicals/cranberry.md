Cranberry, a vibrant red, tart berry, is botanically known as *Vaccinium macrocarpon* or *Vaccinium oxycoccos*. Originating from North America, particularly the northern United States and Canada, its name is believed to derive from "craneberry," as its flower resembles the head and neck of a sandhill crane. While not indigenous to India, cranberries have gained significant popularity in recent decades, primarily through imports. They are celebrated globally for their distinctive sharp flavour and high nutritional value, particularly their rich content of Vitamin C, dietary fibre, and potent antioxidants, including proanthocyanidins.

In Indian home kitchens, cranberries are a relatively modern addition, not featuring in traditional culinary practices. However, their versatility has led to their adoption in contemporary Indian cooking, especially in urban settings. Fresh cranberries are occasionally used in sauces, chutneys, or baked goods, often paired with sugar to balance their intense tartness. Dried cranberries, often sweetened, are more commonly found, incorporated into breakfast cereals, trail mixes, and desserts, or even as a tangy counterpoint in some fusion salads and rice preparations. Cranberry pulp, derived from the crushed fruit, is primarily used for making juices and preserves.

Industrially, cranberries are a significant ingredient in India's burgeoning FMCG sector. Cranberry juice and juice blends are widely available, marketed for their health benefits, particularly for urinary tract health. Candied cranberries are a popular inclusion in snack bars, muesli, and various bakery products like muffins and cookies, providing a chewy texture and a burst of sweet-tart flavour. Cranberry pulp is a key component in the production of jams, jellies, and fruit-based beverages, offering both flavour and natural colour. The fruit's robust flavour profile also makes it suitable for flavouring yogurts, ice creams, and even some savoury sauces.

Consumers in India sometimes confuse cranberries with *karonda* (Carissa carandas), a native Indian tart berry. While both are small, red, and possess a sharp, acidic flavour often used in preserves and chutneys, they are botanically distinct. Cranberries are a North American bog fruit, whereas *karonda* is a shrub native to the Himalayas and Western Ghats. The confusion stems from their similar appearance and tartness, but their origins, specific flavour nuances, and traditional culinary applications in India are entirely different. Cranberries are also distinct from other imported berries like blueberries or raspberries, each possessing unique flavour and textural characteristics.
