# Chikoo

Chikoo, known botanically as *Manilkara zapota* and often referred to as sapodilla or sapota, is a tropical fruit believed to be native to southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was introduced to India, likely by Portuguese traders, and has since become a beloved and widely cultivated fruit across the subcontinent. The name "Chikoo" itself is thought to be derived from "chicle," the milky latex sap extracted from the tree, historically used as a base for chewing gum. Today, major chikoo-growing regions in India include Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where the warm, humid climate is ideal for its cultivation.

In Indian home kitchens, chikoo is primarily enjoyed fresh and ripe, either eaten out of hand or incorporated into refreshing beverages. Its distinctively sweet, malty flavour and slightly grainy, soft texture make it a popular choice for milkshakes and smoothies, often blended with milk and a touch of sugar. It also finds its way into traditional Indian desserts such as kheer (pudding) and halwa, where its natural sweetness and unique aroma enhance the dish. Less commonly, it is used in jams, preserves, or fruit salads, offering a unique tropical note.

Industrially, chikoo sees more limited processing compared to other mainstream fruits, yet it is utilized in various modern applications. Its pulp is processed for fruit juices, nectars, and ice creams, contributing a natural sweetness and thick consistency. The fruit's high sugar content and unique flavour profile also make it suitable for flavouring in some confectionery items and as a component in dried fruit snacks. As a source of natural sugars and dietary fibre, chikoo pulp can be found in certain health-oriented food products, though its presence is not as ubiquitous as more acidic or vibrant fruits.

A common point of confusion for consumers often revolves around the fruit's nomenclature and ripeness. While "Chikoo" is the widely recognized and beloved name in India, it is botanically known as sapodilla or sapota, leading to occasional ambiguity for those unfamiliar with the regional variations. Furthermore, distinguishing a perfectly ripe chikoo from an unripe one can be challenging; an unripe chikoo is hard and astringent, whereas a ripe one yields slightly to pressure and has a soft, sweet, and juicy flesh. It is distinct from other brown-skinned fruits like kiwi, which possess a tart flavour and different internal texture.
