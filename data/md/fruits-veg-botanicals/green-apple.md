Green Apple, botanically classified under *Malus domestica*, is a widely recognized fruit, with the 'Granny Smith' cultivar being the most prominent green variety globally. Originating from Central Asia, apples were introduced to the Indian subcontinent primarily during the British colonial era, finding fertile ground in the temperate Himalayan regions. Today, major apple-growing states in India include Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand, where specific microclimates support the cultivation of various apple types, including the crisp, tart green varieties. In local parlance, it is often referred to as "Hara Seb," distinguishing it from its red counterparts.

In Indian home kitchens, green apples are primarily consumed fresh, either as a standalone snack or incorporated into fruit salads for their refreshing crunch and tangy flavour. While not a traditional staple in cooked Indian dishes, their tartness makes them an excellent candidate for modern chutneys, relishes, and even certain savoury preparations where a souring agent is desired, offering a distinct profile compared to tamarind or raw mango. They are also juiced, often blended with other fruits or vegetables, and occasionally feature in baked desserts, reflecting a growing adoption of Western culinary influences.

Industrially, green apples are a significant ingredient in the FMCG sector. Their robust flavour and acidity make them ideal for producing juices, ciders, and fruit-based beverages. The distinct "green apple flavour" is widely used in candies, jellies, yogurts, and other confectionery items, often as an artificial flavouring. Furthermore, their slower oxidation rate compared to some other apple varieties makes them a preferred choice for pre-cut fruit salads and processed fruit products, ensuring better shelf life and visual appeal. Extracts from green apples also find applications in the cosmetic industry for their perceived skin benefits and refreshing aroma.

Consumers often distinguish green apples from red apples primarily by their taste and texture. Green apples are typically tarter and firmer, making them preferred for baking, salads, or as a palate cleanser, whereas red apples are generally sweeter and softer, favoured for direct consumption. While both are apples, their distinct flavour profiles lead to different culinary applications. It is also important to note that while green apples offer a tartness, they are distinct from other souring agents like raw mangoes or limes, each imparting a unique flavour and aroma to dishes.
