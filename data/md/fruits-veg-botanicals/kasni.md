**Kasni**

Kasni, botanically identified as *Cichorium intybus* or common chicory, holds a venerable place in India's traditional medicinal systems, particularly Ayurveda and Unani. Its name, derived from Sanskrit, reflects its ancient recognition and widespread use. While not strictly native to India, it has been naturalized and cultivated across various regions, thriving in temperate climates, and is often found growing wild. Historically, its roots and leaves have been valued for their therapeutic properties, with references dating back centuries in classical texts for their role in supporting liver and digestive health.

In traditional Indian homes, Kasni is primarily revered for its medicinal attributes rather than as a staple culinary ingredient. Its bitter leaves are occasionally incorporated into salads or cooked as greens in certain regional cuisines, though this is less common than its medicinal applications. The roasted and ground roots have a long history of being used as a coffee substitute or additive, especially in South India, lending a distinct earthy bitterness and depth to beverages. The "distillate of Kasni," known as Kasni Arka in Ayurvedic practice, is a traditional preparation, valued for its concentrated therapeutic essence and consumed for specific health benefits, particularly for liver and kidney support.

Industrially, Kasni's most significant application in India is as chicory root, a common additive in instant coffee blends, where it enhances body, colour, and a characteristic bitter note, while also reducing production costs. Beyond beverages, chicory-derived inulin, a soluble dietary fiber, is widely used as a functional ingredient in the food industry. It serves to improve texture, add sweetness, and boost fiber content in products ranging from dairy alternatives to baked goods and health supplements. The "distillate of Kasni" also finds its way into modern herbal formulations and health tonics, marketed for liver support and digestive health.

A primary point of confusion for consumers often lies in understanding that "Kasni" is the Indian vernacular for chicory. Furthermore, the distinction between the whole Kasni plant (leaves, roots) and its "distillate" is crucial. While the whole plant is used for its raw form or roasted roots, the distillate (Arka) is a concentrated liquid extract, specifically prepared for its potent medicinal properties, often targeting liver and kidney health. It is also important to differentiate chicory-blended coffee from pure coffee, as the former offers a different flavour profile and caffeine content due to the presence of the chicory root.
