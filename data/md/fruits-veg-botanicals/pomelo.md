# Pomelo

The pomelo (scientific name: *Citrus maxima* or *Citrus grandis*), known in India by names such as *chakotra* (Hindi), *babbulimass* (Tamil), and *chakotara* (Bengali), is the largest fruit of the citrus family. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions spanning Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and southern China, its introduction to India dates back centuries, likely through ancient trade routes that facilitated the exchange of exotic produce. Today, pomelos are cultivated across various Indian states, with significant presence in the northeastern regions, parts of South India (Kerala, Karnataka), and some northern plains, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.

In Indian home kitchens, the pomelo is primarily enjoyed fresh, its large, juicy segments often consumed as a refreshing snack, sometimes sprinkled with a mix of salt, chilli powder, and sugar to enhance its sweet-tart flavour. It is also a popular addition to fruit salads and can be juiced for a revitalising drink. Beyond raw consumption, pomelo finds its way into regional culinary traditions, occasionally featuring in tangy chutneys, pickles, or as a souring agent in certain savoury preparations, lending a unique citrusy zest.

Industrially, the pomelo's applications are diverse, though less widespread than more common citrus fruits. Its juice is sometimes used in beverage formulations, either on its own or blended with other fruit juices. The thick rind, rich in essential oils and pectin, is processed to create candied peels, marmalades, and jams. Extracts from the fruit and peel are also utilised in the flavouring industry for confectionery and baked goods, and its essential oils find a niche in the cosmetics and fragrance sectors for their refreshing aroma.

A common point of confusion for consumers is distinguishing the pomelo from the grapefruit. While both are large citrus fruits, the pomelo is generally larger, has a significantly thicker pith, and its flesh is typically less bitter and often sweeter than that of a grapefruit. Genetically, the grapefruit itself is a hybrid of the pomelo and a sweet orange, making the pomelo its ancient ancestor. Its distinct, slightly chewy texture and unique balance of sweetness and mild bitterness set it apart from other citrus varieties, including large oranges, which lack the pomelo's characteristic thick rind and segmented structure.
