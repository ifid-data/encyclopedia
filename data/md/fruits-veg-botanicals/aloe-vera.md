# Aloe Vera

Aloe Vera, known botanically as *Aloe barbadensis miller*, is a succulent plant with a rich history deeply intertwined with traditional Indian medicine, particularly Ayurveda, where it is revered as "Ghrita Kumari" or "Kumari" (meaning "young maiden," alluding to its rejuvenating properties). Originating from the Arabian Peninsula, it was introduced to India centuries ago and is now widely cultivated across arid and semi-arid regions, especially in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh, thriving in dry climates. Its historical significance lies in its extensive use in ancient texts for its purported healing attributes.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Aloe Vera is not a staple culinary ingredient in the same way as vegetables or spices. However, its gel has been historically consumed for its health benefits, often blended into concoctions or fresh juices to aid digestion, boost immunity, and promote overall well-being. It's occasionally incorporated into homemade remedies for skin ailments or consumed as a tonic, reflecting its role more as a medicinal botanical than a conventional food item in domestic settings.

Modern industrial applications of Aloe Vera are vast and diverse, particularly within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Its hydrating and soothing properties make it a popular ingredient in cosmetics, including skincare lotions, gels, and hair products. In the food and beverage industry, Aloe Vera is extensively used in health drinks and juices (M-JUICE), often found in canned (P-CAN) formats, valued for its perceived detoxifying and digestive benefits. Aloe Vera bits (M-BITS), also typically canned (P-CAN), are incorporated into beverages and desserts to provide a unique textural element, enhancing the consumer experience in modern health-conscious products.

Consumers often encounter Aloe Vera in various forms, leading to some confusion regarding its usage. It is crucial to distinguish between the whole plant and its processed edible forms. The raw plant contains a yellow latex layer between the green rind and the clear gel, which contains aloin, a potent laxative. Edible Aloe Vera products, such as aloe vera juice or bits, are specifically processed to remove this aloin, ensuring they are safe for consumption. Furthermore, while "aloe vera juice" refers to the liquid extract, "aloe vera bits" are small, translucent pieces of the gel, primarily added to drinks for texture rather than a distinct flavour, both distinct from the raw gel used topically.
