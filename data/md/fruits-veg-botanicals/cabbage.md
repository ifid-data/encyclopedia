Cabbage, scientifically *Brassica oleracea* var. *capitata*, is a leafy green or purple biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable. Originating from the wild cabbage native to the Mediterranean and Western Europe, it was introduced to India much later, likely through European trade and colonial influence. Despite its non-native origins, cabbage has seamlessly integrated into Indian agriculture and cuisine, thriving in temperate climates across states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. Its robust nature and relatively short growing cycle have made it a staple crop, widely cultivated by farmers for both local consumption and broader markets.

In Indian home kitchens, cabbage is a versatile and economical vegetable. It is commonly prepared as a simple *sabzi* (dry vegetable dish), often stir-fried with spices like mustard seeds, cumin, turmeric, and green chillies, sometimes combined with peas or potatoes. It also features prominently in *kofta* (vegetable dumplings), *pakoras* (fritters), and as a filling for *parathas* or *momos*. In South India, it's used in *thoran* or *poriyal*, a finely chopped and sautéed preparation with coconut. Its mild flavour and crisp texture make it a popular addition to salads and slaws, particularly in contemporary Indian culinary practices.

Industrially, cabbage is primarily utilized as a raw ingredient in various processed food products. It is a common component in frozen mixed vegetable packs, ready-to-eat meals, and instant noodle seasoning sachets. Its fibrous texture and ability to absorb flavours make it suitable for inclusion in vegetable curries, soups, and stews produced for the FMCG sector. Furthermore, cabbage is a key ingredient in the catering industry, used in large-scale preparations for institutions, restaurants, and event management, often shredded for salads or cooked into bulk dishes.

Consumers often encounter cabbage alongside its botanical cousin, cauliflower. While both belong to the *Brassica oleracea* species, they are distinct cultivars. Cabbage forms a dense, leafy head, with edible leaves that can be smooth or crinkled, varying in colour from green to red or purple. Cauliflower, on the other hand, is characterized by its compact, white (or sometimes purple, green, or orange) head of undeveloped flower florets, known as the "curd." Their textures and subtle flavour profiles differ, with cabbage offering a more pronounced leafy crunch and a slightly peppery note, while cauliflower is milder and creamier when cooked.
