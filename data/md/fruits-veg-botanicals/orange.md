# Orange

The orange (Citrus sinensis) boasts a rich history deeply intertwined with the Indian subcontinent, believed to have originated in a region spanning Northeast India, Myanmar, and Southwest China. Its Sanskrit name, 'naranga', is the etymological root for its designation across many languages, signifying its ancient presence and widespread cultivation. Introduced to India millennia ago, oranges quickly became an integral part of the agricultural landscape. Today, major Indian growing regions include Maharashtra (Nagpur), Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Punjab, contributing significantly to both domestic consumption and processing.

In Indian home kitchens, oranges are primarily enjoyed fresh, as whole fruit or refreshing juice. The vibrant segments are often incorporated into fruit salads and desserts. Beyond the pulp, orange peels are highly valued for their aromatic zest, finding use in traditional sweets, marinades, and some regional savoury dishes, imparting a bright, citrusy note. Candied or glazed orange peels are popular homemade confections. In Ayurvedic practices, oranges are recognized for their cooling properties and as a rich source of Vitamin C, aiding digestion and boosting immunity.

The industrial application of oranges in India is extensive, driven by their versatility. The juice industry is a primary consumer, utilizing vast quantities of orange pulp and juice concentrate for packaged beverages, squashes, and cordials. Orange oil, extracted from the peels, is a prized ingredient in the flavouring industry for confectionery, baked goods, and carbonated drinks. Processed forms like orange powder and orange peel powder are crucial for instant drink mixes, spice blends, health supplements, and cosmetic formulations, offering convenience and extended shelf life. Glazed orange peels are widely used in commercial bakeries for fruit cakes and decorative elements, while orange pulp cells are often added back to industrial juices to enhance texture and mouthfeel.

While "orange" typically refers to the whole fruit, consumers often encounter various processed forms, leading to some confusion regarding their specific applications. Orange pulp, orange peels, and orange powder are distinct derivatives, each with unique functional properties. Fresh orange juice differs significantly from industrial versions, which may contain added orange pulp cells for consistency and texture. Furthermore, "citrus pulp" is a broader category that can encompass orange pulp but may also refer to pulp from other citrus fruits, used generically in food processing for fibre or texture.
