**Stinging Nettle**

Stinging Nettle, scientifically known as *Urtica dioica*, is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant with a rich history spanning millennia, valued for its medicinal, nutritional, and textile properties. While not native to India, it has naturalized and thrives in temperate regions, particularly in the Himalayan foothills and other cooler, moist areas across the subcontinent. Known by various local names such as "Bichhu Buti" (scorpion plant) in Hindi, "Sisno" in Nepali, and "Shivan" in some regional dialects, its presence in Indian traditional medicine, particularly Ayurveda and folk remedies, is well-documented for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties. Its historical use as a fiber source for textiles also highlights its versatility beyond consumption.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Stinging Nettle is treated as a wild edible green, albeit one requiring careful handling. The characteristic "sting" from its trichomes (fine hairs) containing histamine and formic acid is neutralized through cooking. It is commonly blanched, boiled, or sautéed before being incorporated into dishes. In Himalayan communities, it is a prized ingredient for hearty soups (like Sisno ko Saag), curries, and simple stir-fries, often paired with lentils or local grains. Its earthy, slightly bitter flavour and nutrient-dense profile, rich in iron, vitamins A and C, and minerals, make it a valuable addition to the diet, especially in regions where it grows abundantly.

While Stinging Nettle has a strong traditional presence, its industrial application in the Indian food sector remains niche. It is primarily found in the form of herbal teas, dietary supplements, and extracts, marketed for its health benefits rather than as a mainstream culinary ingredient. Its use in FMCG products is limited, though global trends in natural ingredients and functional foods could see increased interest. Beyond food, nettle extracts are explored for natural dyes, cosmetics, and even as a potential biopesticide, showcasing its diverse industrial potential.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding Stinging Nettle due to its distinctive stinging property. It is crucial to distinguish it from other non-stinging edible greens or plants that might cause skin irritation but lack the specific chemical composition of *Urtica dioica*. The defining characteristic of true Stinging Nettle is the immediate, sharp, and often lasting irritation caused by contact with its raw leaves, a sensation that is entirely eliminated upon proper cooking. This unique defense mechanism is what sets it apart from other leafy vegetables and underscores the importance of correct identification and preparation.
