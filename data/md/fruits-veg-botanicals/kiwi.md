Kiwi, scientifically known as *Actinidia deliciosa*, is a vibrant green fruit with a distinctive tangy-sweet flavour and fuzzy brown skin. Originating from China, where it was historically known as the "Chinese gooseberry," it was later introduced to New Zealand and subsequently renamed "kiwifruit" after the country's national bird. Its introduction to India is relatively recent, primarily in the latter half of the 20th century, driven by agricultural diversification efforts. Today, kiwi cultivation is gaining traction in India's cooler, hilly regions, particularly in states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and parts of the North-Eastern states such as Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, where the climate is conducive to its growth.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh kiwi is primarily enjoyed as a refreshing fruit, often consumed raw, peeled, and sliced. Its unique flavour profile makes it a popular addition to fruit salads, smoothies, and desserts like custards, tarts, and ice creams. While not traditionally part of ancient Indian culinary practices due to its non-native origin, it has seamlessly integrated into modern Indian gastronomy, frequently used as a garnish for contemporary dishes, in mocktails, and as a flavouring agent in various sweet preparations, appreciated for its bright colour and zesty taste.

Industrially, kiwi finds extensive application, particularly in its processed forms. Kiwi juice concentrate, obtained by removing water from fresh kiwi juice, is a key ingredient in the FMCG sector. This concentrated form offers significant advantages in terms of extended shelf life, reduced storage and transportation costs, and consistent flavour delivery. It is widely utilised in the production of packaged juices, nectars, squashes, fruit-based beverages, and as a flavouring component in yogurts, jams, jellies, and confectionery. The concentrate, often packaged in cans for preservation and ease of distribution, provides a convenient way for manufacturers to incorporate kiwi's characteristic taste and nutritional benefits, including its high Vitamin C content, into a diverse range of products.

A common point of confusion arises between the fresh kiwi fruit and its processed derivative, kiwi juice concentrate. While fresh kiwi offers the full sensory experience of the fruit—its fibrous texture, vibrant colour, and nuanced flavour—kiwi juice concentrate is a highly processed ingredient. The concentrate, having most of its water removed, is primarily valued for its intense flavour and acidity, making it ideal for industrial applications where consistency and shelf stability are paramount. It is crucial to understand that while the concentrate retains the essence of kiwi, it lacks the textural complexity and some of the volatile compounds present in the whole, fresh fruit.
