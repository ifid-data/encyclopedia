### Nuts Paste

Nuts paste, a versatile culinary ingredient, refers to a smooth, viscous preparation made by grinding various nuts, often with a small amount of liquid or oil. While the concept of grinding nuts for culinary purposes is ancient and global, its application in Indian cuisine is deeply rooted in regional traditions, particularly in enriching gravies and desserts. India, being a significant producer of cashews and peanuts, and a consumer of almonds and walnuts, has a long history of incorporating these nutrient-dense ingredients into its food culture. The practice of creating pastes from nuts likely evolved from the need to thicken dishes, add richness, and extend the shelf life of nuts in a more manageable form.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, nuts paste is a cornerstone for creating luxurious and creamy textures. Cashew paste (kaju paste) is famously used in Mughlai and North Indian curries like korma, shahi paneer, and malai kofta, imparting a characteristic richness and a subtle sweetness. Almond paste (badam paste) is a key ingredient in traditional sweets such as badam halwa, badam milk, and various barfis, prized for its delicate flavour and smooth mouthfeel. Peanut paste finds its place in regional specialties, often as a base for spicy chutneys, gravies in Maharashtrian and South Indian cuisines, or as a binding agent in snacks.

The industrial food sector widely utilizes nuts paste for its functional and flavour-enhancing properties. In FMCG, it serves as a primary ingredient in ready-to-eat curries, sauces, and a variety of spreads, most notably peanut butter and almond butter. The bakery and confectionery industries employ nuts paste in fillings for chocolates, pralines, cookies, and energy bars, leveraging its emulsifying capabilities and rich flavour profile. Furthermore, with the rise of plant-based diets, nuts paste is increasingly used as a base for dairy alternatives like nut milks, yogurts, and cheeses, contributing protein, healthy fats, and desirable textures.

Consumers often encounter "nuts paste" as a generic term, which can lead to confusion with specific nut pastes or nut flours. A generic "nuts paste" might imply a blend of different nuts or a general category, whereas specific products like "cashew paste" or "almond butter" are typically mono-ingredient. It is crucial to distinguish nuts paste from nut flours; while both are derived from nuts, pastes retain the natural oils, resulting in a smooth, viscous consistency ideal for thickening and richness, whereas flours are dry and powdery, primarily used for structure and binding. Nuts paste is also distinct from whole nuts, which offer a textural crunch rather than a creamy base.
