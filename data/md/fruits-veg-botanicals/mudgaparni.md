# Mudgaparni

Mudgaparni, botanically identified as *Phaseolus trilobus* (syn. *Vigna trilobata*), is a lesser-known wild legume deeply embedded in India's traditional medicinal systems, particularly Ayurveda. Its name, derived from Sanskrit, literally translates to "moong-leafed," indicating its leaves' resemblance to those of the common moong bean (*Vigna radiata*). Native to the Indian subcontinent, this herbaceous plant thrives in diverse environments, from plains to hilly regions, and has been revered since ancient times for its therapeutic properties, often mentioned in classical Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita as a vital component of formulations like 'Dashamoola' (ten roots).

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Mudgaparni's direct culinary application as a staple food is relatively limited compared to its cultivated legume cousins. Historically, its small seeds and leaves might have been consumed by tribal and rural communities, especially during times of scarcity, either cooked as a vegetable or incorporated into simple broths. However, its primary traditional use has always been medicinal, where its roots and whole plant are utilized in decoctions, powders, and pastes for their purported cooling, anti-inflammatory, and rejuvenating effects.

Modern industrial applications of Mudgaparni in the food sector are minimal. It is not typically processed for large-scale food production due to its wild nature and the availability of more commercially viable legumes. Its main industrial presence is within the nutraceutical and Ayurvedic pharmaceutical industries, where extracts and powders are incorporated into health supplements, herbal medicines, and traditional formulations aimed at supporting liver health, digestion, and overall vitality. Its functional properties are primarily leveraged for therapeutic rather than nutritional or textural purposes in processed foods.

A common point of confusion arises from its name, "Mudgaparni," which often leads consumers to conflate it with "Mudga" or moong bean (*Vigna radiata*). While both belong to the legume family and share a superficial resemblance in leaf structure, they are distinct species with vastly different primary uses. Mudgaparni is predominantly a wild, medicinal herb with smaller seeds and a focus on therapeutic applications in Ayurveda, whereas moong bean is a widely cultivated, domesticated pulse, a staple in Indian cuisine, consumed daily for its nutritional value and versatility in dishes like dal, sprouts, and sweets. Mudgaparni is not a culinary substitute for moong dal.
