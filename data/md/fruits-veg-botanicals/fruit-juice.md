**Fruit Juice**

The practice of extracting and consuming the liquid essence of fruits is deeply embedded in human history, with India boasting a rich tradition of indigenous fruit-based beverages. From the ubiquitous *nimbu pani* (lemonade) and refreshing sugarcane juice to regional specialties like *bel sharbat* and *kokum sharbat*, fresh fruit juices have long been cherished for their hydrating and therapeutic properties. The modern packaged fruit juice industry, while a relatively recent development in India, draws upon this ancient heritage, sourcing a diverse array of fruits such as mangoes, oranges, apples, guavas, and pomegranates from the country's varied agricultural landscapes.

In Indian home kitchens, fruit juices are primarily consumed fresh, either as a standalone refreshment or as part of traditional remedies and wellness practices. They serve as a foundational element for numerous homemade beverages, including various *sharbat* preparations and even certain *lassi* variations. Beyond direct consumption, fruit juices are occasionally incorporated into desserts, marinades, and sometimes as a natural souring or flavouring agent in specific culinary applications, reflecting their versatility.

Industrially, fruit juices are a cornerstone of the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, predominantly as ready-to-drink beverages. Concentrated fruit juices are a critical component, allowing for efficient transport and extended shelf life before reconstitution. These concentrates, along with various fruit juice forms, are widely utilized as natural flavourings and sweeteners in a broad spectrum of products, including confectionery, dairy items like yogurts, and bakery goods. Furthermore, specific fruit juice extracts are processed to yield natural fruit juice colours, employed as food colourants, while mixed fruit juices cater to evolving consumer preferences for diverse flavour profiles and perceived nutritional benefits.

A common point of confusion for Indian consumers lies in distinguishing between "100% Fruit Juice," "Nectars," and "Fruit Drinks." True 100% fruit juice contains only the liquid extracted from fruit, with no added sugar or water. Nectars, however, typically contain a significant proportion of fruit pulp or juice, but with added water and sweeteners. "Fruit Drinks" often have the lowest fruit content, frequently relying on high sugar levels, artificial flavours, and additives. Consumers also frequently conflate the nutritional profile and benefits of freshly prepared, unprocessed juices with those of pasteurized, packaged varieties, which may undergo changes in nutrient composition due to processing.
