**Brihati**

Brihati, botanically identified as *Solanum indicum* (though modern taxonomy often refers to *Solanum violaceum* or *Solanum torvum*), holds a revered position in the ancient Indian system of Ayurveda. Its name, derived from Sanskrit, signifies "large" or "great," possibly alluding to its broad leaves or profound therapeutic efficacy. Native to the Indian subcontinent, this perennial shrub thrives in diverse climatic conditions, commonly found growing wild in plains and hilly regions across India. It is a crucial component of the 'Dashamoola' (ten roots) formulation, specifically belonging to the 'Brihat Panchamoola' (five greater roots), underscoring its historical significance in traditional medicine.

In traditional Indian households, Brihati is not typically used as a culinary ingredient in the conventional sense due to its bitter taste. Instead, its roots, fruits, and leaves are integral to various Ayurvedic preparations. It is commonly prepared as a decoction (kwath) to address respiratory ailments like cough and asthma, and as an expectorant. Its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties make it a traditional remedy for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions. It is also valued for its digestive stimulant and carminative actions, often incorporated into formulations aimed at improving gut health.

Industrially, Brihati is a key ingredient in numerous Ayurvedic pharmaceutical products. It is processed into powders (churna), medicated oils (taila), and fermented preparations (arishta and asava) by manufacturers of herbal medicines. Its extracts are increasingly found in modern nutraceuticals and dietary supplements, particularly those marketed for respiratory support, joint health, and general well-being. Ongoing scientific research continues to explore its rich profile of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, steroids, and flavonoids, validating its traditional uses and potential for new applications.

Consumers and practitioners often encounter confusion between Brihati (*Solanum indicum*) and Kantakari (*Solanum virginianum* or *Solanum xanthocarpum*), another prominent medicinal plant from the same Solanum genus. Both are prickly nightshades and are part of the Dashamoola, with Kantakari belonging to the 'Laghu Panchamoola' (five lesser roots). While both share some therapeutic properties, particularly in respiratory care, they are distinct species with unique phytochemical profiles and specific applications in Ayurvedic formulations. Brihati is often colloquially referred to as "Badi Kateri" (large prickly nightshade), distinguishing it from Kantakari, or "Choti Kateri" (small prickly nightshade).
