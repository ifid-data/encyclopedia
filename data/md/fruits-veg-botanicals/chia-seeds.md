**Chia Seeds**

Chia seeds (*Salvia hispanica*) trace their origins to ancient Mesoamerica, where they were a staple food for Aztec and Mayan civilizations, revered for their energy-boosting properties and medicinal value. The name "chia" itself is derived from the Nahuatl word "chian," meaning "oily." While not indigenous to India, chia seeds have seen a significant surge in popularity over the last two decades, primarily as a health food import. Most of the supply comes from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Australia, though some nascent cultivation is emerging in suitable regions within India.

In Indian home kitchens, chia seeds have been enthusiastically adopted into modern dietary practices, often integrated into breakfast and snack routines. They are most commonly consumed after being soaked in water, milk, or plant-based alternatives, forming a gelatinous texture. This is then added to smoothies, juices, lassi, or used to create nutritious puddings. Their mild, nutty flavour makes them a versatile addition to overnight oats, yogurt, and fruit salads. They are also incorporated into baked goods like bread, muffins, and energy bars, providing a boost of fibre and healthy fats.

The food industry has embraced chia seeds for their functional properties and nutritional density. In FMCG products, they are a popular ingredient in health-focused offerings such as breakfast cereals, granola bars, energy drinks, and gluten-free baked goods. Their unique ability to absorb up to 10-12 times their weight in liquid and form a mucilaginous gel makes them an excellent natural thickener, emulsifier, and binder. This gelling property is particularly valuable in vegan and plant-based formulations, where they can serve as an egg substitute in baking or as a texturizer in dairy-free desserts and spreads, enhancing both nutritional value and mouthfeel.

A frequent point of confusion in the Indian market arises between chia seeds and sabja seeds (basil seeds, *Ocimum basilicum*). While both are small, dark seeds that swell and form a gel when soaked, they possess distinct characteristics. Chia seeds are typically oval, slightly larger, and come in a mix of grey, black, and white, forming a thicker, more uniform gel. Sabja seeds, on the other hand, are smaller, rounder, uniformly black, and develop a more pronounced white halo around each seed when hydrated, creating a thinner gel. Nutritionally, chia seeds are significantly richer in Omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, and protein, whereas sabja seeds are more known for their cooling properties and are traditionally used in Indian beverages like falooda and sherbets.
