# Raspberries

Raspberries are the aggregate fruit of various species of the genus *Rubus*, primarily *Rubus idaeus*. While native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, their cultivation in India is a relatively recent phenomenon, primarily confined to cooler, high-altitude regions such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and parts of the North-Eastern states. These regions provide the necessary temperate climate for their growth. Unlike many fruits deeply embedded in India's ancient culinary traditions, raspberries lack a historical linguistic root in classical Indian languages, reflecting their later introduction and adoption into the Indian diet.

In Indian home kitchens, raspberries are primarily embraced in contemporary culinary applications rather than traditional dishes. They are a popular choice for modern desserts, including tarts, cheesecakes, and fruit salads, owing to their vibrant colour and distinctive tart-sweet flavour. They are also frequently incorporated into smoothies, milkshakes, and homemade jams and preserves, offering a refreshing and tangy counterpoint to richer Indian sweets. Their delicate texture and bright acidity make them a favoured garnish for a variety of dishes.

Industrially, raspberries are highly valued for their flavour, colour, and nutritional profile. They are extensively used in the FMCG sector as a natural flavouring and colouring agent in a wide array of products. This includes yogurts, ice creams, confectionery, fruit-based beverages, breakfast cereals, and baked goods like muffins and pastries. Raspberry purées, concentrates, and freeze-dried forms are common ingredients, providing a consistent flavour and vibrant hue to processed foods, catering to the growing demand for exotic and health-conscious ingredients in the Indian market.

A common point of confusion in India arises from the phonetic similarity between "raspberry" and "rasbhari." While both are berries, "rasbhari" typically refers to the Cape gooseberry (*Physalis peruviana*), a distinct fruit with a papery husk and a different flavour profile, often more tart and less intensely sweet than a raspberry. Furthermore, raspberries are often distinguished from other common berries like strawberries or mulberries by their hollow core, velvety texture, and a unique balance of tartness and sweetness that sets them apart in both flavour and culinary application.
