**Giloy**

Giloy, scientifically known as *Tinospora cordifolia*, is a revered herbaceous vine deeply embedded in the annals of Indian traditional medicine, particularly Ayurveda. Its Sanskrit name, Guduchi, translates to "one that protects the whole body" or "nectar," underscoring its profound significance. Historically, Giloy has been documented in ancient Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita for its extensive therapeutic properties. Indigenous to tropical and subtropical regions of India, it thrives as a climbing shrub, often seen entwining around other trees, earning it the epithet "Amrita Valli" (the divine creeper). The stem of the Giloy plant is the primary part utilized for its medicinal value, though leaves and roots also find application.

In traditional Indian households, Giloy is not typically a culinary ingredient but rather a staple in home remedies. Its fresh stem is often crushed to extract juice, or dried and powdered to prepare decoctions (kadha) or churna. These preparations are traditionally consumed to bolster immunity, manage fevers, support liver function, and aid digestion. Its characteristic bitter taste is often masked with honey or other ingredients when consumed. The plant's adaptogenic properties are highly valued, believed to help the body adapt to stress and maintain overall well-being.

Modern industrial applications of Giloy primarily revolve around the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sectors. Standardized Guduchi extracts are widely incorporated into dietary supplements, health drinks, and Ayurvedic formulations. These extracts, often concentrated for specific bioactive compounds, offer consistent potency and convenience, making them suitable for capsules, tablets, and syrups aimed at boosting immunity, promoting detoxification, and providing anti-inflammatory benefits. Its growing popularity has led to its inclusion in various wellness products, reflecting a global interest in traditional Indian herbs.

A common point of confusion arises from the interchangeable use of "Giloy" and "Guduchi"; both terms refer to the same plant, *Tinospora cordifolia*, with Guduchi being its classical Ayurvedic name. Furthermore, consumers often differentiate between the raw Giloy stem, traditionally prepared at home, and the processed Guduchi extract found in commercial products. While the stem offers the full spectrum of the plant's compounds, extracts are standardized for specific active principles, providing a more consistent dosage. It is also important to distinguish Giloy from other medicinal vines, as its unique properties are specific to *Tinospora cordifolia*.
