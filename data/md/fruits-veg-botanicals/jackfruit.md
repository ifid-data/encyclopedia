The jackfruit, known as *Kathal* in Hindi and *Chakka* in Malayalam, is a colossal tropical fruit native to the Western Ghats of South India. Its botanical name, *Artocarpus heterophyllus*, reflects its diverse leaf forms. Evidence suggests its cultivation dates back millennia, with its presence deeply woven into the culinary and cultural fabric of states like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, where it is a significant agricultural produce and often revered as a state fruit. The name "jackfruit" itself is believed to be a corruption of the Malayalam word "chakka" by the Portuguese.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, jackfruit is celebrated for its remarkable versatility, utilized at various stages of ripeness. Unripe, green jackfruit is treated as a vegetable, its fibrous texture making it an excellent "vegetarian meat" substitute in hearty curries like *Kathal ki Sabzi*, stir-fries, and even deep-fried chips. When fully ripe, the fruit transforms into a sweet, aromatic delicacy, enjoyed fresh, incorporated into desserts, jams, juices, and ice creams, particularly in South Indian cuisine where it features prominently in dishes like *Chakka Varatti* (jackfruit preserve).

Modern food processing has significantly expanded jackfruit's reach. Canned jackfruit (P-CAN) is widely available, with unripe versions gaining immense popularity globally as a plant-based meat alternative due to its neutral flavour and shreddable texture, ideal for vegan pulled "pork" or "chicken" dishes. The ripe jackfruit pulp (M-PULP), often canned, serves as a convenient base for industrial applications in ready-to-eat desserts, fruit bars, and beverages, ensuring year-round availability of its distinct tropical sweetness. Its seeds are also roasted or boiled and used in curries, showcasing the fruit's complete utility.

A common point of confusion arises from the jackfruit's dual identity based on its ripeness. Consumers often conflate the unripe, savoury "vegetable" jackfruit with the sweet, ripe "fruit" jackfruit. While the former is prized for its meaty texture in curries and as a vegan substitute, the latter is cherished for its intense sweetness and aroma in desserts. Furthermore, the convenience of canned jackfruit, whether unripe for savoury preparations or as ripe pulp for sweet applications, distinguishes it from the fresh, whole fruit, which requires significant effort to process.
