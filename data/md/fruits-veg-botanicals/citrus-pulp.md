# Citrus Pulp

Citrus pulp, comprising the juice sacs or vesicles from various citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and limes, holds a significant place in India's culinary and industrial landscape. Citrus fruits themselves have a long and rich history in the subcontinent, with several varieties being indigenous or introduced centuries ago. Major citrus-growing regions span Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and the North-Eastern states, providing a consistent supply. Historically, the consumption of whole citrus fruits meant the natural inclusion of this pulp, valued for its texture and nutritional content.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, citrus pulp is primarily encountered as an integral part of fresh fruit consumption or homemade beverages. Whether it's a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, a tangy nimbu pani (lemonade), or a refreshing mosambi (sweet lime) juice, the presence of pulp is often cherished for its natural mouthfeel and a perception of freshness. It also finds its way into homemade marmalades, jams, and preserves, where its fibrous structure contributes to the desired consistency and body.

Industrially, citrus pulp, often processed and canned (P-CAN) for extended shelf life and ease of transport, is a crucial ingredient in the food and beverage sector. It is widely incorporated into packaged fruit juices, nectars, and fruit drinks to enhance body, provide a "freshly squeezed" appearance, and contribute to the overall sensory experience. Beyond beverages, citrus pulp is utilized in fruit preparations for yogurts, ice creams, bakery fillings, and confectionery, acting as a natural texturizer and a source of dietary fiber and natural fruit solids.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the various components of citrus fruits. Citrus pulp, specifically referring to the cellular juice sacs (M-PULP), is distinct from the clear, filtered juice (the liquid component) and also from citrus fiber, which is typically extracted from the peel, albedo, or membranes for its functional properties as a thickening or gelling agent. While zest provides aromatic oils and the juice offers liquid refreshment, citrus pulp is the solid, cellular material that imparts body, texture, and a concentrated burst of fruit flavour.
