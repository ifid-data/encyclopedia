# Wheatgrass

Wheatgrass, derived from the young shoots of the common wheat plant (Triticum aestivum), represents a modern health trend rather than a traditional Indian culinary staple. While wheat cultivation boasts ancient roots in India, the practice of consuming its tender, chlorophyll-rich shoots for their purported health benefits gained prominence globally in the 20th century and subsequently in India. It is typically cultivated in controlled environments, either indoors or in small plots, specifically for its leaves, rather than for grain production. Its adoption in India aligns with a growing interest in natural wellness and 'superfoods', resonating with broader Ayurvedic principles of holistic health and rejuvenation, though not explicitly mentioned in classical texts.

In Indian home kitchens, wheatgrass is not used in traditional cooking methods like tempering or frying. Instead, its primary application is as a health supplement. Fresh wheatgrass is commonly juiced, often combined with other fruits and vegetables like apple, ginger, or amla, to create nutrient-dense beverages. The juice is consumed for its perceived detoxifying and energizing properties, making it a popular choice among health-conscious individuals seeking a natural boost to their diet.

The industrial and modern applications of wheatgrass largely revolve around its convenience and extended shelf life. Wheatgrass powder, obtained by dehydrating and grinding the fresh shoots, is a prevalent form in the FMCG sector. This powdered variant is widely incorporated into dietary supplements, 'green superfood' blends, health drinks, and sometimes fortified food products. The powder offers a practical way to integrate wheatgrass's nutritional profile, including chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals, into daily routines, making it accessible beyond the immediate availability of fresh produce.

Consumers often encounter a distinction between fresh wheatgrass and wheatgrass powder. Fresh wheatgrass is typically juiced immediately after harvesting, offering a potent, raw form with its full enzymatic activity. Wheatgrass powder, while convenient and shelf-stable, is the dehydrated and ground form, which may undergo slight changes in its nutrient profile due to processing. It is also crucial to differentiate wheatgrass from mature wheat, which is harvested for its grains. Wheatgrass specifically refers to the young, leafy shoots, consumed for their unique nutritional composition rather than as a grain source.
