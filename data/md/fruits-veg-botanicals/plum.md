Plum, known in India primarily as ‘Aloo Bukhara’ (a term of Persian origin), refers to various species within the *Prunus* genus, most commonly *Prunus domestica*. While its origins trace back to China and later Europe, plums have found a comfortable home in India's temperate regions. Major cultivation hubs include the hilly states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and certain parts of the North-Eastern states, where the climate is conducive to their growth. The fruit's introduction to the subcontinent is largely attributed to historical trade routes and cultural exchanges, embedding it into local agricultural practices and culinary traditions.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh plums are a seasonal delight, savored for their juicy, sweet-tart flesh. They are frequently transformed into delectable chutneys, jams, and preserves, offering a burst of flavor that complements various meals. Beyond these, plums find their way into traditional desserts, tarts, and occasionally even savory preparations, particularly in regional cuisines that appreciate their unique balance of sweetness and acidity. Dried plums, or prunes, are also consumed, valued for their concentrated flavor and nutritional benefits.

Industrially, plums and their derivatives are significant ingredients in the FMCG sector. Plum pulp (M-PULP) is a versatile component, extensively utilized in fruit-based beverages, yogurts, ice creams, and various fruit preparations for confectionery and bakery items. Its natural sweetness, tartness, and vibrant color make it a popular choice for flavorings and natural colorants in processed foods. The pulp also contributes to the desired texture and mouthfeel in many products, acting as a natural thickener and moisture retainer, enhancing the overall sensory experience.

Consumers often encounter plums in different forms, leading to a distinction between the whole fruit and its processed derivatives. The whole plum fruit is primarily enjoyed fresh or used in home cooking for its distinct texture and complete flavor profile. Plum pulp, however, is a processed ingredient, typically employed in industrial applications where a consistent, concentrated fruit base is required. It is valued for its functional properties—flavor, color, and ability to contribute to texture—rather than the structural integrity of the whole fruit. This pulp is also distinct from plum juice concentrate, which is a more refined product with a higher Brix value.
