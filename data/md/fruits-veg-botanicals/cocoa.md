# Cocoa

Cocoa, derived from the seeds of the *Theobroma cacao* tree, boasts a rich history originating in Mesoamerica, where it was revered by ancient civilizations as a sacred beverage and currency. The term "cacao" stems from the Nahuatl "cacahuatl." Introduced to India during the British colonial era, commercial cultivation gained traction post-independence, primarily in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. While not indigenous, cocoa has become an integral part of India's modern food landscape, transitioning from an exotic import to a locally sourced ingredient.

In Indian home kitchens, cocoa is predominantly embraced for its role in sweet preparations. Cocoa powder is a staple for baking cakes, cookies, and brownies, and for preparing popular beverages like hot chocolate, milkshakes, and chocolate-flavoured kheer or custards. While traditional Indian savoury cuisine rarely features cocoa, its distinct bitter-sweet profile is increasingly explored in contemporary fusion dishes, adding depth to marinades or sauces. Its versatility makes it a beloved ingredient for both everyday treats and festive desserts.

The industrial application of cocoa in India is vast, forming the backbone of the confectionery and FMCG sectors. Cocoa mass (or liquor), the ground whole cocoa bean, is the primary ingredient for chocolate manufacturing. Cocoa butter, extracted from the mass, is prized for its unique melting properties, crucial for the snap and mouthfeel of quality chocolates. Cocoa powder, available in natural or alkalized (Dutch-processed) and fat-reduced forms, is extensively used as a flavouring, colouring, and bulking agent in biscuits, ice creams, health drinks, and baked goods. Alkalization provides a darker colour and milder, less acidic flavour, preferred in many commercial applications.

A common point of confusion arises from the terms "cacao" and "cocoa"; "cacao" generally refers to the plant or raw beans, while "cocoa" denotes the processed products. Within processed forms, consumers often conflate cocoa mass (the ground whole bean), cocoa butter (the extracted fat), and cocoa powder (the defatted solids). Each has distinct functional properties. Furthermore, misspellings like "coco powder" or "chocoa powder" are frequently encountered in the Indian market, though they refer to the same ingredient. It is also important to distinguish between natural cocoa powder, which is acidic and lighter in colour, and alkalized (Dutch-processed) cocoa powder, which has a neutral pH, darker hue, and milder flavour due to a treatment with an alkaline solution.
