**Sesbania**

Sesbania refers to a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, with *Sesbania grandiflora* being the most prominent species consumed in India. Known by its Sanskrit name "Agastya" and Tamil "Agathi," this fast-growing tree is believed to be indigenous to Southeast Asia and has been cultivated across tropical and subtropical regions for centuries. In India, it is widely grown, particularly in the southern states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, where its leaves and flowers are a cherished part of the local diet. Its name "Agastya" is often associated with the revered sage, reflecting its deep cultural and medicinal roots in the subcontinent.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, the tender leaves and vibrant flowers of *Sesbania grandiflora* are highly valued for their unique flavour profile and nutritional benefits. The leaves, often referred to as "Agathi Keerai," are typically stir-fried (poriyal), incorporated into lentil stews (koottu), or added to thin, spiced broths (rasam). The delicate flowers, known as "Agathi Poo," are also used in similar preparations, often lightly sautéed or added to sambar, imparting a subtle bitterness that is prized for its digestive and cooling properties, especially in Ayurvedic traditions.

While *Sesbania grandiflora* has limited direct industrial food applications, its broader genus, Sesbania, plays a significant role in agriculture. Various species are cultivated as green manure, improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, and as fodder for livestock. The plant's rapid growth and high biomass production make it valuable in agroforestry systems. Research is ongoing into its potential as a source of plant-based protein and fibre for functional foods, given its rich nutritional composition, though it is not yet a mainstream ingredient in processed food products.

Consumers often encounter "Sesbania" primarily through its edible leaves and flowers, which are distinct from other common Indian greens like spinach (palak) or amaranth (chaulai). *Sesbania grandiflora* is characterized by its slightly bitter taste and unique texture, which sets it apart. It is crucial to understand that "Sesbania" is a broad botanical genus, and while *S. grandiflora* is the primary edible species, other Sesbania species are cultivated for non-culinary purposes such as green manure or animal feed, and are not typically consumed by humans.
