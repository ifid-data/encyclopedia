# Pumpkin Seeds

Pumpkin seeds, known colloquially as *kaddu ke beej* in Hindi, are the edible seeds derived from various pumpkin species, primarily *Cucurbita pepo*. These seeds boast an ancient lineage, originating in North America where indigenous cultures have cultivated pumpkins and consumed their seeds for thousands of years. While pumpkins are a ubiquitous crop across India, grown extensively in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, the commercial harvesting and processing of their seeds for direct consumption have gained significant momentum more recently. They are now a popular health food, sourced from both domestic cultivation and international markets, reflecting their growing demand.

In Indian home kitchens, pumpkin seeds are cherished for their nutritional value and versatility. They are most commonly enjoyed roasted and lightly salted as a wholesome snack, offering a satisfying crunch and a mild, nutty flavour. Their appealing texture makes them an excellent garnish for a variety of dishes, from fresh salads and yogurts to breakfast cereals and traditional Indian sweets like kheer or halwa. Modern culinary trends also see them incorporated into homemade granola, energy bars, or even ground into a coarse powder to enrich smoothies and some savoury preparations, adding both texture and a nutritional boost.

The industrial food sector in India has increasingly integrated pumpkin seeds into a diverse range of FMCG products. They are a staple in health-oriented items such as trail mixes, nutritional bars, and breakfast cereals, as well as in artisanal breads and crackers, where they contribute flavour, texture, and a wealth of micronutrients. While less common than other edible oils, pumpkin seed oil is also extracted for its distinct flavour and health benefits, finding niche applications in gourmet cooking and specialized salad dressings. Their rich profile of zinc, magnesium, and healthy fats positions them as a key ingredient in the expanding health and wellness food segment.

Consumers in India often encounter a wide array of edible seeds, which can sometimes lead to confusion. Pumpkin seeds are distinct from other popular seeds like watermelon seeds (*tarbooz ke beej*) or muskmelon seeds (*kharbooze ke beej*). While all are valued for their nutritional content, pumpkin seeds possess a unique flavour profile, a characteristically flatter shape, and a greener hue when hulled, along with a notably higher concentration of zinc. It is important to differentiate these nutrient-dense seeds from the whole pumpkin fruit itself, as the seeds represent a concentrated source of specific beneficial compounds.
