# Onion

The onion (Allium cepa), known as *pyaz* in Hindi, *kanda* in Marathi, and *vengayam* in Tamil, is a foundational ingredient in Indian cuisine, with a history stretching back millennia. Originating in Central Asia, its cultivation spread to India and beyond, becoming indispensable. Archaeological evidence and ancient texts suggest its presence in the subcontinent for over 5,000 years, valued for both its culinary and medicinal properties. Today, India is one of the world's largest producers, with major growing regions spanning Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh, each contributing distinct varieties to the national larder.

In Indian home kitchens, the onion is paramount, forming the aromatic base for countless gravies, curries, *sabzis*, and *biryanis*. Typically sautéed until translucent or golden brown, it imparts a characteristic sweetness and depth of flavour. Raw, it features prominently in *kachumber* salads, raitas, and chutneys, offering a pungent, crisp counterpoint to rich dishes. Varieties like the common red onion, the milder white onion, and the delicate spring onion (or scallion) are employed for specific textures and flavour profiles, from the robust base of a *rogan josh* to the fresh garnish on a *dal*.

The industrial food sector leverages the onion's versatility through various processed forms. Dehydrated onion powder and flakes are staples in instant mixes, snack seasonings (for *namkeen* and chips), ready-to-eat meals, and spice blends, offering concentrated flavour and extended shelf-life without the moisture content of fresh onions. Roasted or toasted onion flakes and powder are used to impart deeper, more complex, and smoky notes to processed foods, while onion flavouring agents and extracts provide consistent taste profiles in a wide array of FMCG products, from sauces to marinades.

Consumers often encounter various forms of onion, leading to some confusion. The primary distinction lies between fresh onions and their processed counterparts: fresh onions provide essential moisture, texture, and a complex array of volatile compounds that evolve during cooking, whereas onion powder or flakes offer a concentrated, dry flavour, ideal for applications where moisture is undesirable or shelf-life is critical. Furthermore, different varieties like shallots (smaller, milder, often preferred in South Indian and gourmet preparations) and spring onions (immature onions, valued for their tender green tops and subtle flavour) are distinct from the common red or white bulb onions, each serving unique culinary purposes.
