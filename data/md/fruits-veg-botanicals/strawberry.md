### Strawberry

The strawberry, botanically *Fragaria × ananassa*, is a widely cultivated hybrid species of the genus *Fragaria*, commonly known as strawberries. While not indigenous to India, its introduction is largely attributed to colonial influences, gaining popularity in the post-independence era. Belonging to the Rosaceae family, it thrives in temperate climates. In India, significant cultivation began in regions with suitable cool conditions, primarily in the hilly states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir. Maharashtra's Mahabaleshwar, Tamil Nadu's Ooty, and parts of Karnataka and Punjab have also emerged as key growing areas, making it a seasonal delight across the country.

In Indian home kitchens, the strawberry has rapidly transitioned from an exotic fruit to a beloved seasonal staple. It is predominantly consumed fresh, either on its own or as a vibrant addition to fruit salads. Its sweet-tart profile makes it a popular choice for desserts, featuring prominently in milkshakes, smoothies, ice creams, tarts, and cheesecakes. Homemade jams, preserves, and compotes are also common, allowing households to enjoy its flavour beyond its short season. Its adoption reflects a broader shift in Indian culinary preferences, embracing global fruits while integrating them into contemporary dessert traditions.

Industrially, strawberry is a highly versatile ingredient, extensively used across the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Its various forms cater to diverse applications: strawberry pulp and puree are foundational for fruit preparations in yogurts, ice creams, and dessert fillings, providing natural flavour and texture. Strawberry juice, often from concentrate, is a popular base for beverages, squashes, and jellies. Strawberry powder is utilized in dry mixes, flavouring agents for confectionery, and even in some nutritional supplements, offering a concentrated flavour profile. Preserved strawberry fruit finds its way into bakery toppings, pie fillings, and as inclusions in chocolates and cereals, ensuring year-round availability and consistent quality.

Consumers often encounter various forms of strawberry products, leading to some confusion regarding their nature. It's crucial to distinguish between fresh strawberry fruit and its processed derivatives. "Strawberry juice" typically refers to the liquid extracted directly from the fruit, while "strawberry juice from concentrate" indicates that water has been removed and later re-added, a common practice for shelf stability and transport. Similarly, "strawberry powder" is a dehydrated form of the fruit, distinct from artificial strawberry flavourings which mimic the taste without containing actual fruit solids. Understanding these distinctions helps consumers appreciate the varying levels of fruit content and processing in their favourite strawberry-flavoured items.
