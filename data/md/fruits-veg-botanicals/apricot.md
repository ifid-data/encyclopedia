### Apricot

The apricot, known in India primarily as *khubani* (from Persian), is a cherished stone fruit with a rich history deeply intertwined with ancient trade routes. Originating in Central Asia or China, apricots were introduced to India centuries ago, likely via the Silk Road, finding fertile ground in the cooler, temperate regions of the Himalayas. Today, major apricot-growing states in India include Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, and Uttarakhand, where they are a significant part of the local economy and diet. The fruit's name itself, "apricot," is believed to have evolved from Latin through Arabic and Old French, reflecting its journey across cultures.

In Indian home kitchens, apricots are enjoyed in various forms. Fresh apricots are savoured seasonally, while dried apricots (khubani) hold a more prominent place in traditional cuisine, particularly in North India and the Deccan. They are a staple in desserts like *khubani ka meetha* from Hyderabad, and are often incorporated into rich stews, pilafs, and sweet-and-sour chutneys. Apricot kernels, though less common, are sometimes used for their oil, or, with caution, as a bitter almond substitute in certain regional sweets, adding a unique flavour profile. Apricot pulp and juice are also prepared at home for jams, preserves, and refreshing beverages.

Industrially, apricots are a versatile ingredient in the FMCG sector. Apricot pulp and juice are widely utilized in commercial fruit juices, nectars, jams, and fruit-based yogurts, valued for their distinctive flavour and nutritional benefits, including high Vitamin A and fibre content. Dried apricots are a popular inclusion in breakfast cereals, granola bars, and trail mixes, catering to health-conscious consumers. Apricot kernel oil also finds application in the cosmetic industry for its emollient properties, and occasionally in niche food products as a flavouring agent or cooking oil in specific regions.

Consumers often encounter apricots in different forms, leading to some confusion. The most common distinction to clarify is between the fresh fruit and its dried counterpart, *khubani*. While fresh apricots are enjoyed for their juicy, tart-sweet flavour, dried khubani offers a concentrated sweetness and chewy texture, making it ideal for cooking and baking. Furthermore, the apricot kernel, though part of the fruit, is distinct in its usage and properties; it is primarily used for oil extraction or as a flavouring, and should not be confused with the edible fruit pulp due to the presence of amygdalin, which can be toxic if consumed in large quantities without proper processing.
