**Blueberry**

Blueberries, scientifically *Vaccinium corymbosum* and related species, are small, round berries native primarily to North America. Unlike many fruits deeply embedded in India's ancient culinary traditions, blueberries are a relatively recent introduction to the Indian market, gaining popularity through globalized food trends and increased awareness of their nutritional benefits. There are no indigenous linguistic roots for "blueberry" in India; the English term is widely adopted. While commercial cultivation within India is nascent and limited to specific cooler, high-altitude regions, the majority of blueberries consumed in the country are imported, often from North America, Chile, or other global producers.

In Indian home kitchens, blueberries are not part of traditional cooking but have found a niche in modern, Western-inspired preparations. They are commonly used in breakfast items like pancakes, waffles, and smoothies, or incorporated into baked goods such as muffins, cheesecakes, and tarts. Their sweet-tart flavour and vibrant colour also make them popular additions to fruit salads, yogurts, and as garnishes for desserts, reflecting a contemporary shift in dietary preferences towards global ingredients.

Industrially, blueberries are a significant ingredient in the FMCG sector. They are extensively used in the production of fruit yogurts, breakfast cereals, jams, jellies, and fruit-based beverages. Processed forms, such as canned blueberries (P-CAN), frozen blueberries, and blueberry purees, are particularly valuable for industrial applications due to their extended shelf life, consistent quality, and ease of incorporation into various products, from bakery fillings to ice cream flavourings. Their high antioxidant content also makes them a popular inclusion in health supplements and functional foods.

Consumers often encounter blueberries in various forms, leading to some confusion. Fresh blueberries offer a distinct texture and peak flavour, ideal for immediate consumption or fresh preparations. However, canned or frozen blueberries, while convenient and available year-round, may have a softer texture and slightly altered flavour profile due to processing. It's also important to distinguish blueberries from native Indian berries like mulberries (shahtoot) or jamun, which, despite sharing a similar dark hue, possess unique flavour characteristics and are botanically distinct from the North American blueberry.
