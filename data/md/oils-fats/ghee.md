**Ghee**

Ghee, known in Sanskrit as "ghṛta," holds a revered place in Indian culinary and cultural heritage, with its origins tracing back to ancient Vedic times. It is an anhydrous milk fat, traditionally prepared by simmering butter until the water evaporates and milk solids separate, leaving behind a clear, golden liquid. Historically, ghee was a staple in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits and was indispensable in religious rituals and ceremonies, symbolizing purity and prosperity. While primarily derived from cow's milk, buffalo milk is also used, particularly in regions where buffalo farming is prevalent. The term "desi ghee" specifically refers to traditionally made ghee, often implying a more authentic or artisanal product.

In Indian home kitchens, ghee is an indispensable fat, celebrated for its distinctive nutty aroma and rich flavour. It is widely used for tempering (tadka) dals, curries, and vegetables, providing a foundational layer of flavour. Ghee is also a preferred medium for shallow-frying various snacks, roasting spices, and preparing traditional sweets like halwa, ladoo, and barfi. Its high smoke point makes it suitable for various cooking methods, and it is commonly drizzled over hot rotis, parathas, and rice dishes to enhance their taste and texture.

In modern industrial applications, ghee finds its niche in premium food products. It is a key ingredient in the commercial production of traditional Indian sweets, savouries (namkeen), and certain bakery items, where its unique flavour and mouthfeel are highly valued. While its cost often limits its use as a primary industrial frying medium compared to more economical refined vegetable oils, it is incorporated into ready-to-eat meals and gourmet products to impart an authentic Indian taste profile. The demand for "desi cow ghee" has also spurred a market for organic and ethically sourced variants in the FMCG sector.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding ghee's identity, particularly distinguishing it from regular butter and other fats. Ghee is essentially clarified butter; unlike butter, it contains no water or milk solids, giving it a longer shelf life and a higher smoke point. It is also fundamentally different from Vanaspati, which is a hydrogenated vegetable fat designed as a cheaper substitute for ghee, lacking its characteristic flavour and nutritional profile. The term "desi ghee" or "cow ghee" further differentiates traditionally prepared, often pasture-fed, cow-derived ghee from more generic or industrially processed versions, which may vary in flavour and perceived quality.
