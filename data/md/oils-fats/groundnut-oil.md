### Groundnut Oil

Groundnut oil, also widely known as peanut oil and locally as *moongfali tel* (Hindi) or *kadalai ennai* (Tamil), is a prominent edible oil in Indian culinary traditions. The groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) itself is native to South America, introduced to India by Portuguese traders in the 16th century. It quickly adapted to the Indian climate, becoming a major oilseed crop. Today, India is one of the largest producers, with significant cultivation concentrated in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, where it forms a cornerstone of regional diets. Traditionally, the oil was extracted using cold-pressing methods, often in *ghani* (wooden expellers), preserving its distinct nutty aroma and flavour.

In Indian home kitchens, groundnut oil is a versatile staple, particularly favoured in Western and Southern Indian cuisines. Its relatively high smoke point makes it ideal for deep-frying a variety of snacks such as *pakoras*, *puris*, *vadas*, and *bhajiyas*, imparting a subtle, pleasant flavour without overpowering the ingredients. It is also extensively used for everyday cooking, including sautéing vegetables, preparing curries, and for tempering (*tadka*) dals and chutneys, where its mild profile allows the spices to shine.

Industrially, groundnut oil is a preferred choice for many food manufacturers due to its stability and neutral flavour when refined. Refined groundnut oil is widely utilized in the production of packaged snacks like *namkeen*, potato chips, and other fried savouries, owing to its excellent frying performance and extended shelf life. Its consistent quality and sensory neutrality also make it suitable for use in processed foods, ready-to-eat meals, and various sauces and dressings, contributing to texture and mouthfeel without imparting strong inherent flavours.

A common point of confusion arises between cold-pressed (unrefined) and refined groundnut oil. Cold-pressed groundnut oil retains more of its natural nutrients, a stronger nutty aroma, and a distinct flavour, making it popular for specific culinary applications where its character is desired. However, it has a lower smoke point and shorter shelf life. Refined groundnut oil, on the other hand, undergoes processing to remove impurities, resulting in a neutral flavour, higher smoke point, and longer shelf life, making it the preferred choice for general-purpose frying and industrial applications. It is also distinct from other common vegetable oils like sunflower or soy oil, each possessing unique fatty acid profiles and culinary characteristics.
