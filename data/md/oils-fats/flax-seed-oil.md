Flax Seed Oil, known in India as *Alsi ka Tel*, is an edible oil derived from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant (*Linum usitatissimum*). Flax has a venerable history, with archaeological evidence suggesting its cultivation dates back thousands of years, making it one of the oldest cultivated crops globally. In India, flax has been traditionally grown across various regions, particularly in states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, primarily for its seeds and fibre. The oil is typically extracted through cold-pressing, a method that preserves its delicate nutritional profile by avoiding high temperatures.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, flax seeds (*Alsi*) have been consumed roasted or ground, often incorporated into chutneys, laddoos, or as a digestive aid. However, flax seed oil itself is not a conventional cooking oil for high-heat applications due to its low smoke point and susceptibility to oxidation. Instead, it is valued for its nutritional benefits and is typically consumed raw. It is often drizzled over salads, added to smoothies, mixed into yogurt, or used as a finishing oil for cooked dishes, providing a subtle, nutty flavour without undergoing heat degradation.

Industrially, flax seed oil is highly prized for its rich content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid. This makes it a popular ingredient in the health and wellness sector, frequently encapsulated as a dietary supplement. Beyond supplements, it finds application in functional foods such as certain health breads, energy bars, and fortified dairy alternatives, where its nutritional benefits can be integrated without requiring high-temperature processing. Its unique fatty acid composition also lends itself to non-food applications, including paints, varnishes, and linoleum, though these are distinct from its edible forms.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding flax seed oil and flax seeds. While both are derived from the same plant and offer similar health benefits, the oil is a concentrated source of the beneficial fatty acids, particularly ALA, and lacks the fibre present in the whole seeds. It is also crucial to distinguish flax seed oil from other omega-3 sources like fish oil; flax seed oil provides plant-based ALA, which the body converts into EPA and DHA, whereas fish oil directly provides EPA and DHA. Furthermore, due to its high polyunsaturated fat content, flax seed oil is highly prone to rancidity and requires careful storage, typically in dark, cool conditions, unlike more stable cooking oils.
