Soy oil, often referred to as soybean oil, is an edible oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean (Glycine max). Originating in East Asia, soybeans have been cultivated for millennia, primarily for their protein-rich beans. Its introduction to India is relatively modern, gaining significant traction in the latter half of the 20th century as a versatile and affordable cooking medium. In India, it is commonly known as "soya tel" or simply as a generic "vegetable oil." Major soybean cultivating states in India include Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, making India one of the world's leading producers and consumers of this oil.

In Indian home kitchens, refined soy oil has become a ubiquitous cooking fat due to its neutral flavour profile and high smoke point. These characteristics make it ideal for a wide range of culinary applications, from deep-frying traditional snacks like pakoras and samosas to sautéing vegetables and preparing everyday curries and dals. Unlike traditional regional oils such as mustard or coconut oil, which impart distinct flavours, soy oil's neutrality allows the inherent tastes of the ingredients to shine, making it a preferred choice for general-purpose cooking across diverse Indian cuisines.

Industrially, refined soy oil is a cornerstone of the Indian food processing sector. Its stability, cost-effectiveness, and neutral taste make it an invaluable ingredient in numerous FMCG products. It is extensively used for frying snack foods, including namkeen, chips, and savouries. Furthermore, it serves as a primary component in the production of margarines, shortenings, salad dressings, and mayonnaise. Its functional properties, particularly in its refined form, contribute to improved texture, mouthfeel, and shelf life in baked goods and various processed foods, solidifying its role in modern food manufacturing.

Consumers in India often use the terms "soy oil" and "vegetable oil" interchangeably, as soy oil frequently forms the base or a significant component of many commercially available "vegetable oil" blends. It is crucial to distinguish refined soy oil from unrefined varieties, which have a stronger flavour and lower smoke point, making them less suitable for high-heat cooking. Moreover, while soy oil can be an ingredient in hydrogenated vegetable fats (Vanaspati), it is distinct from them; refined soy oil is typically in its liquid, unhydrogenated form, offering a different nutritional and functional profile compared to solid Vanaspati.
