Fats have been an indispensable component of Indian culinary and cultural heritage for millennia. Historically, indigenous fats like ghee (clarified butter) from dairy, and various vegetable oils such as mustard, sesame, and coconut oil, formed the bedrock of regional cuisines. Ghee, in particular, holds sacred significance in Hindu rituals and is revered for its flavour and medicinal properties in Ayurveda. Sourcing was traditionally local, with dairy fats from cattle and buffalo, and vegetable oils extracted from seeds and fruits cultivated across diverse agro-climatic zones – mustard in the north, coconut in the south, and groundnut in central and western India. The term "fat" encompasses these culturally specific ingredients.

In the Indian home kitchen, fats are far more than just cooking mediums; they are flavour carriers, texture enhancers, and essential elements of culinary technique. Ghee is prized for its nutty aroma in tempering dals, enriching biryanis, and lending richness to sweets like ladoos and halwas. Mustard oil is characteristic of Bengali and North Indian cooking, used for its pungent flavour in curries and pickles. Coconut oil dominates South Indian cuisine, providing a distinct aroma and mouthfeel to sambar, avial, and various stir-fries. Fats are crucial for deep-frying snacks like pakoras and puris, providing crispness and a golden hue, and for sautéing spices to release their aromatic compounds, forming the base of countless dishes.

In modern food processing and FMCG, fats play a critical functional role beyond traditional cooking. They are integral to achieving desired textures, mouthfeel, and shelf stability in a vast array of products, from biscuits and confectionery to ready-to-eat meals and snack foods. Industrial fats, often derived from palm, soy, or sunflower, are selected for specific properties like melting point, oxidative stability, and emulsifying capabilities. "Fat powder," a dehydrated form of fat, finds application in convenience foods, beverage mixes, and nutritional supplements, offering ease of incorporation, extended shelf life, and controlled fat delivery without altering the product's physical state. These processed forms allow for precise formulation and consistent product quality on a large scale.

The term "fat" often leads to confusion due to its broad nature and varied implications. Consumers frequently conflate "fat" as a general macronutrient with specific "fats" (like ghee or cooking oil) as ingredients. Nutritional labels further distinguish between "total fat" and "saturated fat," which refers to a specific type of fatty acid chain. While all cooking oils and ghee are sources of "fat," they differ significantly in their fatty acid profiles (e.g., saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated). "Fat powder," a functional ingredient, is a dehydrated form of fat used for specific industrial applications, distinct from the liquid or semi-solid fats typically used in home cooking. This distinction is vital for both culinary understanding and nutritional awareness.
