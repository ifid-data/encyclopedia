**Kokum Fat**

Kokum fat, also known as Kokum Gurgi, is a prized vegetable fat extracted from the seeds of the *Garcinia indica* tree, an indigenous species primarily found in the Western Ghats region of India, particularly in Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka. The name "Kokum" itself is derived from Marathi, reflecting its deep roots in the local culture and economy of these areas. Historically, the fruit and its derivatives have been integral to regional culinary and medicinal practices, with the fat being traditionally rendered and used for its emollient and therapeutic properties.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Kokum fat's direct use as a primary cooking medium is less common due to its specific properties and higher cost compared to other prevalent oils. However, it finds niche applications in regional sweets and confections, where its unique texture and stability are valued. It can be incorporated into certain traditional desserts or used as a thickening agent, contributing a smooth mouthfeel and preventing crystallization. Its high melting point means it remains solid at room temperature, making it suitable for specific preparations requiring structural integrity.

Industrially, Kokum fat is highly valued for its unique triglyceride composition, particularly its high content of stearic-oleic-stearic (SOS) triglycerides. This makes it an excellent cocoa butter replacer (CBR) or extender in the confectionery industry, especially in chocolates, candies, and compound coatings, where it imparts a desirable snap, gloss, and melt-in-the-mouth quality. Beyond food, its emollient and non-comedogenic properties make it a popular ingredient in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors, used in balms, lotions, soaps, and medicinal ointments.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding Kokum fat, sometimes conflating it with the whole Kokum fruit or its dried rind, which is used as a souring agent in curries. It is crucial to distinguish Kokum fat as the extracted lipid from the seeds, which is solid at room temperature, from the tart, reddish-purple fruit or its processed forms. Unlike common liquid vegetable oils such as groundnut or sunflower oil, Kokum fat is a specialty fat with a distinct fatty acid profile and a sharp melting curve, making it functionally unique and not a general-purpose cooking oil.
