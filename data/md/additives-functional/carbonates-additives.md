Carbonates, a class of chemical compounds containing the carbonate ion, have a long history in food processing, often derived from natural mineral sources. Historically, substances like wood ash (potash, rich in potassium carbonate) or limestone (calcium carbonate) were used for their alkaline properties. In India, traditional alkaline salts such as *sajji khar* (crude sodium carbonate) were employed as leavening agents or to tenderize legumes. Today, the food industry utilizes purified and synthesized forms, including ammonium bicarbonate (INS 503), potassium carbonates (INS 501), magnesium carbonate (INS 504), and calcium carbonate (INS 170), sourced from mineral deposits or chemical synthesis.

In Indian home kitchens, direct use of these specific carbonates is less common than related compounds like baking soda. However, ammonium bicarbonate, known as "baker's ammonia," is a niche ingredient for creating exceptionally crisp and airy biscuits, cookies, and certain fried snacks, as it completely volatilizes during baking, leaving no residual taste. Calcium carbonate, while not a direct cooking ingredient, might be present in fortified flours or as a firming agent in some traditional preserves, though its industrial application is far more prevalent.

Carbonates are indispensable in the modern food industry, serving multiple functional roles. As **acidity regulators** (INS 501, 503, 504), they control pH in various products. Ammonium bicarbonate (INS 503) is a primary **raising agent** in dry baked goods like crackers and biscuits, providing a light, crisp texture. Calcium carbonate (INS 170) is extensively used as a **stabilizer** and **firming agent** in canned fruits, vegetables, and dairy alternatives, maintaining texture. It also functions as a **bread improver** and **dough conditioner** (INS 1700, 1701) and is a crucial **calcium fortificant** in flours and cereals. Magnesium carbonate (INS 504) is often an **anticaking agent** in powdered foods. Potassium carbonates (INS 501) are used in cocoa processing to "Dutch" cocoa, enhancing colour and mellowing flavour.

The term "Carbonates (Additives)" encompasses a family of distinct chemical compounds, each with specific applications. Consumers often do not differentiate between ammonium bicarbonate (INS 503), potassium carbonates (INS 501), magnesium carbonate (INS 504), and calcium carbonate (INS 170). While ammonium bicarbonate is primarily a leavening agent for crisp products, calcium carbonate is predominantly a fortificant, firming agent, and stabilizer. Potassium carbonates are more often used for pH adjustment and in specific processing like cocoa Dutching. These are also distinct from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and baking powder, common leavening agents in home cooking, each reacting differently.
