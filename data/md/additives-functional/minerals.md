Minerals are inorganic substances essential for the proper functioning of the human body, derived primarily from the earth's crust and water. In India, the understanding of minerals, particularly salt (sodium chloride), dates back millennia, with its importance in diet and preservation deeply embedded in traditional practices and Ayurvedic texts. Historically, communities sourced minerals from natural deposits, mineral-rich waters, and through the consumption of plants and animals that absorb these elements from the soil. The linguistic root "mineral" itself stems from the Latin "minera," referring to a mine or ore, highlighting their geological origin.

In the Indian home kitchen, minerals are primarily consumed as an inherent part of whole foods and, most notably, through the ubiquitous use of salt. Sodium chloride, a fundamental mineral compound, is indispensable for seasoning, flavour enhancement, and as a traditional preservative in pickles, chutneys, and various fermented foods. Other essential minerals like calcium, iron, and potassium are naturally present in a diverse Indian diet rich in dals, grains, vegetables, fruits, and dairy, contributing to both the nutritional profile and subtle flavour nuances of regional cuisines.

Modern food technology and industrial applications extensively leverage minerals for fortification and functional benefits. Mineral mixes, vitamin and mineral blends, and premixes are routinely added to staple foods like flour, edible oils, and salt to combat micronutrient deficiencies, a significant public health initiative in India. In the FMCG sector, minerals are crucial for developing functional beverages (e.g., electrolyte drinks), infant formulas, and dietary supplements. Flavour mineral mixes are also employed in processed snacks and convenience foods, where specific mineral salts can enhance taste profiles and provide textural attributes.

Consumers often conflate the broad term "minerals" with specific compounds like "sodium chloride" (common salt) or with "vitamins." While sodium chloride is indeed a vital mineral, it represents only one of many essential minerals, which include macro-minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and trace minerals such as iron, zinc, and selenium. Furthermore, while minerals are often grouped with vitamins in "nutrient blends," they are distinct: minerals are inorganic elements, whereas vitamins are organic compounds. Both are crucial micronutrients, but their chemical structures and biological roles differ significantly.
