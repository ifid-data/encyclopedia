**Gelatin (INS 428)**

Gelatin, identified by the food additive code INS 428, is a translucent, colourless, brittle, and flavourless food ingredient derived from collagen, a protein found in animal connective tissues, bones, and hides. Its name originates from the Latin "gelatus," meaning "frozen" or "stiff." While not indigenous to traditional Indian culinary practices, gelatin's introduction to India largely came through Western confectionery and pharmaceutical applications. Globally, it is primarily sourced from bovine (cattle) and porcine (pig) collagen, with fish gelatin emerging as an alternative, particularly for communities with specific dietary restrictions. The sourcing of gelatin is a significant consideration in India's diverse dietary landscape, where vegetarianism and religious dietary laws (e.g., Halal, Kosher) necessitate clear declarations of its animal origin.

In Indian home kitchens, gelatin's direct use in traditional cooking is minimal. It is not a staple ingredient for everyday curries or dals. However, with the increasing popularity of global cuisines and desserts, it finds application in preparing Western-style jellies, mousses, panna cottas, and aspics. Its ability to form a thermo-reversible gel, melting when heated and solidifying upon cooling, makes it a versatile agent for setting delicate desserts and moulded dishes, though it remains a niche ingredient compared to more common Indian thickeners.

Industrially, gelatin is a ubiquitous functional ingredient across various sectors in India. In the FMCG space, it is extensively used in confectionery for products like gummy candies, marshmallows, and fruit jellies, providing characteristic chewiness and texture. The dairy industry employs it as a stabilizer and thickener in yogurts, ice creams, and other desserts. Crucially, its film-forming properties make it ideal for pharmaceutical applications, particularly in the manufacturing of hard and soft capsule shells, where it encapsulates medicines and supplements. Its use extends to cosmetics and photography as well, leveraging its unique physical and chemical attributes.

A primary point of distinction and potential confusion for Indian consumers revolves around gelatin's animal origin. Unlike plant-based gelling agents such as agar-agar (derived from seaweed) or pectin (from fruits), gelatin is exclusively animal-derived, typically from bovine or porcine sources, or increasingly, fish. This distinction is critical for vegetarians, vegans, and those adhering to religious dietary guidelines. Consumers often mistakenly assume all gelling agents are interchangeable or plant-based. Therefore, clear labelling of "bovine gelatin," "fish gelatin," or simply "animal gelatin" is essential to inform dietary choices and avoid inadvertent consumption by those who abstain from animal products.
