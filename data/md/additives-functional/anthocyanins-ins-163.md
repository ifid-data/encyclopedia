### Anthocyanins (INS 163)

Anthocyanins (INS 163) are a class of water-soluble pigments responsible for the vibrant red, purple, and blue hues found in many fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Derived from the Greek words "anthos" (flower) and "kyanos" (blue), these natural compounds have been an intrinsic part of human diets and traditional practices for millennia. In India, their presence is deeply rooted in the consumption of indigenous produce like jamun (Indian blackberry), phalsa (Grewia asiatica), purple brinjal, and various berries. Historically, these plant sources were also used for natural dyeing of textiles and foods, long before their chemical structure was understood. Today, anthocyanins are commercially extracted from sources such as grape skins, black carrots, red cabbage, and elderberries, primarily for their coloring properties in the food industry.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, anthocyanins are consumed as an inherent part of whole foods rather than as isolated additives. The rich, deep purple of a jamun sharbat, the reddish tint of a beetroot halwa, or the vibrant hue of a hibiscus tea are all testaments to the natural presence of these pigments. While not consciously added as a separate ingredient, their contribution to the visual appeal and perceived freshness of dishes is significant. Cooks intuitively understand that the color of certain ingredients, like the purple of a specific variety of onion or the deep red of a pomegranate, enhances the overall culinary experience.

As a recognized food additive (INS 163), anthocyanins play a crucial role in the modern Indian food industry. They are widely utilized as natural colorants in a diverse range of FMCG products, including fruit-based beverages, yogurts, confectionery, jams, jellies, and even some processed snacks. Their appeal lies in meeting consumer demand for natural ingredients, offering a clean label alternative to synthetic dyes. Beyond their primary function as a color, anthocyanins are also valued for their antioxidant properties, adding a perceived health benefit to the products they color, though their primary industrial application remains aesthetic.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the distinction between naturally occurring anthocyanins in whole foods and their use as an isolated food additive (INS 163). While both are chemically identical, INS 163 refers to the extracted and concentrated form used to impart color to other food products, making it an "additive" in a regulatory sense. It is crucial to differentiate anthocyanins from synthetic food colors, which are chemically manufactured and do not occur naturally. Furthermore, anthocyanins are highly sensitive to pH, heat, and light, meaning their color can shift from red in acidic conditions to blue or purple in neutral to alkaline environments, and they can degrade over time, unlike more stable synthetic alternatives.
