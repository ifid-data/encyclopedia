**Vitamin D**

Vitamin D, often dubbed the "sunshine vitamin," holds a unique place in human physiology and nutrition, particularly relevant in the Indian context. Its discovery in the early 20th century was pivotal in understanding and preventing rickets, a bone-deforming disease. While the term "vitamin" (from "vital amine") was coined before its chemical structure was fully understood, Vitamin D is technically a prohormone, synthesized in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Despite India's abundant sunlight, Vitamin D deficiency remains a widespread public health concern, attributed to factors like indoor lifestyles, air pollution, and traditional clothing that limits skin exposure, underscoring the need for dietary and supplemental sources.

In home kitchens, Vitamin D is not a direct culinary ingredient but a vital nutrient obtained through food choices. Natural dietary sources are limited but include fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, cod liver oil, and to a lesser extent, egg yolks and certain mushrooms. Traditional Indian diets, often vegetarian, may naturally lack sufficient Vitamin D unless fortified foods are consumed. While not used for tempering or frying, its presence in ingredients like ghee (though minimal) or fortified milk contributes to overall nutritional intake.

Industrially, Vitamin D is a critical fortificant in the Indian food sector. It is widely added to milk, dairy products, edible oils, cereals, and infant formulas to combat widespread deficiency. This fortification is a key public health strategy, ensuring broader access to this essential nutrient. Beyond food, Vitamin D is extensively used in pharmaceutical supplements, available as tablets, capsules, and drops, often combined with calcium for bone health. Its antioxidant properties are also leveraged in certain formulations, contributing to cellular protection, though its primary role is in calcium homeostasis and immune function.

Consumers often encounter Vitamin D in two primary forms: Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol) and Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol). Vitamin D2 is typically derived from plant sources or fungi (like yeast) and is often used in vegetarian or vegan fortified products. In contrast, Vitamin D3 is synthesized in the skin from cholesterol upon sun exposure and is also derived from animal sources, such as lanolin (sheep's wool). While both forms can raise blood Vitamin D levels, Vitamin D3 is generally considered more potent and effective in humans due to its higher bioavailability and longer half-life, making it the preferred choice for many supplements and fortification programs.
