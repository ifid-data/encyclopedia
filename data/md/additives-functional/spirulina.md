# Spirulina

Spirulina, a biomass of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), is a microscopic, spiral-shaped organism renowned for its exceptional nutritional profile. While not indigenous to traditional Indian culinary or medicinal systems, its global recognition as a "superfood" has led to its modern introduction and increasing popularity in India. Historically, Spirulina has been consumed by ancient civilizations, notably the Aztecs, for centuries. In India, its presence is relatively recent, primarily driven by the burgeoning health and wellness industry. It is cultivated in controlled aquatic environments, thriving in warm, alkaline waters, with some commercial cultivation now occurring in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, though a significant portion is still imported.

In Indian home kitchens, Spirulina holds no traditional culinary role. Its usage is entirely a modern phenomenon, primarily as a dietary supplement. It is typically consumed in powdered form, blended into smoothies, fresh juices, or health drinks, where its distinct, often earthy or slightly marine flavour can be masked. Some health-conscious individuals may incorporate small amounts into energy balls, homemade protein bars, or even mix it into doughs for rotis or parathas, primarily for its nutritional boost and vibrant green hue rather than for flavour.

Industrially, Spirulina is a prominent ingredient in the nutraceutical and functional food sectors in India. It is widely processed into tablets, capsules, and powdered supplements, marketed for its high protein content (up to 70%), essential amino acids, vitamins (B complex, E, K), minerals (iron, magnesium), and antioxidants like phycocyanin. This makes it a valuable component in protein powders, fortified beverages, and health bars. Beyond nutrition, the phycocyanin extracted from Spirulina is increasingly used as a natural blue food colouring (INS 141(ii)) in confectionery, dairy products, and beverages, offering a natural alternative to synthetic dyes.

Consumers often encounter Spirulina as a green powder and may confuse it with other plant-based "green superfoods" like wheatgrass, moringa, or chlorella. It is crucial to understand that Spirulina is a cyanobacterium, a type of algae, distinct from land-based plants like wheatgrass or moringa leaves. While all are valued for their nutritional density, their biochemical compositions and specific benefits vary. Spirulina is particularly noted for its complete protein profile and high phycocyanin content, which gives it its characteristic blue-green pigment and potent antioxidant properties, setting it apart from other green supplements.
