# Carmoisine Ins 122

**Carmoisine (INS 122)**

Carmoisine (INS 122, also known as Azorubine or E122) is a synthetic azo dye, a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of an azo group (-N=N-). Its history as a food additive dates back to the early 20th century, gaining widespread adoption due to its vibrant and stable crimson-red hue. Unlike natural colors derived from botanicals, Carmoisine is synthesized chemically, ensuring consistent color properties and availability. In India, as with many other nations, its use is regulated under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as a permitted synthetic food color, identified by its International Numbering System (INS) code 122.

In traditional Indian home cooking, direct use of synthetic food colors like Carmoisine is uncommon, as culinary practices often rely on natural colorants such as turmeric, saffron, or beetroot. However, its presence can be found indirectly in many convenience foods and mixes used in home kitchens. For instance, it might be an ingredient in commercially prepared cake mixes, dessert powders, or ready-to-eat snacks that are then prepared at home, imparting a visually appealing red shade to the final dish.

Industrially, Carmoisine is a highly valued additive in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector due to its excellent stability to heat, light, and pH variations, making it suitable for a wide range of processed foods. It is extensively used in confectionery (candies, jellies), beverages (soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks), dairy products (yogurts, ice creams), processed snacks, jams, and sauces. Its ability to provide a consistent and intense red color, often in combination with other permitted synthetic colors, is crucial for product appeal and brand recognition in the competitive food market.

Consumers often encounter Carmoisine without realizing its specific identity, as it is one of several synthetic red food colors. It is frequently confused with other permitted synthetic red dyes like Ponceau 4R (INS 124) or Allura Red (INS 129), all of which provide similar, though subtly different, red shades. It is also distinct from natural red colorants such as beetroot red (INS 162) or anthocyanins (INS 163), which are derived from plant sources and often have different stability profiles and hues. The presence of "INS 122" or "E122" on ingredient labels signifies its specific identity as a permitted synthetic food color.
