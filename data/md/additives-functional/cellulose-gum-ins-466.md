Cellulose Gum, scientifically known as Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) and identified by the international food additive code INS 466, is a semi-synthetic polymer derived from cellulose. Unlike traditional Indian ingredients with ancient roots, CMC is a product of modern food science, developed in the early 20th century and gaining widespread industrial adoption globally, including in India, from the mid-century onwards. Its production involves chemically modifying natural cellulose, typically sourced from wood pulp or cotton, to enhance its solubility and functional properties in aqueous systems. As such, it does not have a geographical origin within India but is manufactured or imported for use across the country's burgeoning food processing sector.

In the context of Indian home kitchens, Cellulose Gum (INS 466) is not a traditional ingredient. It is not used in everyday cooking for tempering, frying, or as a standalone thickening agent in curries or sweets, where natural alternatives like cornstarch, gram flour, or various dals are preferred. Its application is almost exclusively within the realm of processed and packaged foods, reflecting a shift towards convenience and extended shelf-life products that are increasingly popular in urban and semi-urban Indian households.

Industrially, Cellulose Gum is a highly versatile and indispensable additive in the Indian FMCG landscape. It functions primarily as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier, contributing significantly to the texture, consistency, and shelf stability of a wide array of products. In dairy, it prevents ice crystal formation in ice creams and improves mouthfeel in yogurts and milkshakes. In baked goods, it enhances dough strength, retains moisture, and extends freshness. It is also widely used in sauces, dressings, instant noodles, beverages, and confectionery to provide desired viscosity, prevent ingredient separation, and improve overall product quality and appeal.

Consumers often encounter "Cellulose Gum" and "Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose" interchangeably, as they refer to the same compound (INS 466). It is crucial to understand that this additive is distinct from natural gums like guar gum or xanthan gum, which are derived directly from plants or microbial fermentation. While all serve similar functional roles as thickeners and stabilizers, CMC is a chemically modified cellulose derivative, offering specific rheological properties and stability benefits that make it a preferred choice in many modern food formulations. It is also not to be confused with other cellulose derivatives or simply "cellulose," which might refer to dietary fiber.
