**Polysorbate 60 (INS 435)**

Polysorbate 60, identified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as INS 435, is a synthetic emulsifier and stabilizer widely utilized in the food industry. Chemically, it is polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate, derived from sorbitol, stearic acid, and ethylene oxide. Unlike traditional ingredients, Polysorbate 60 has no historical or traditional roots in Indian culinary heritage, being a product of modern food science. Its introduction to India aligns with the growth of the processed food sector, where it is valued for its ability to bridge oil and water phases, thereby enhancing product stability and texture.

In the context of Indian home kitchens and traditional cooking, Polysorbate 60 finds no direct application. Traditional Indian cuisine relies on natural emulsifiers and stabilizers inherent in ingredients like lentils, starches, and fats, or techniques such as slow cooking and vigorous whisking to achieve desired textures and consistencies. Therefore, this additive is entirely absent from the repertoire of home cooks, who typically prepare dishes from scratch using whole, unprocessed ingredients.

Polysorbate 60 is a workhorse in the industrial food sector, particularly within India's burgeoning FMCG market. Its primary function as an emulsifier prevents the separation of oil and water components in complex food systems, while its stabilizing properties maintain product consistency and extend shelf life. It is extensively used in ice creams to inhibit ice crystal formation, resulting in a smoother mouthfeel. In baked goods, it improves dough handling, increases loaf volume, and enhances crumb structure. Other applications include whipped toppings, gravies, sauces, and confectionery, where it ensures uniform dispersion of ingredients and prevents syneresis.

Consumers often encounter Polysorbate 60 on ingredient labels without fully understanding its role. It is crucial to distinguish it as a synthetic food additive, approved for safe consumption within specified limits by regulatory bodies like FSSAI, from natural emulsifiers such as lecithin. While other polysorbates exist (e.g., Polysorbate 80), Polysorbate 60 is specifically chosen for its stearate component, which lends it particular efficacy in oil-in-water emulsions common in many processed foods. It is not to be confused with other stabilizers like gums, which primarily increase viscosity rather than facilitating emulsion formation.
