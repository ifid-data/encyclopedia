**Diluent (INS 1520)**

Propylene Glycol, designated as INS 1520 by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), is a synthetic organic compound with no historical or traditional presence in Indian culinary heritage. Its origins lie in modern industrial chemistry, developed globally and subsequently adopted in India as the processed food industry expanded and international food additive standards were integrated. It is typically derived from petroleum, though bio-based propylene glycol from renewable sources like glycerol is also produced. Its application in India is consistent with global practices for enhancing the stability and functionality of various food products.

INS 1520 is entirely absent from traditional Indian home kitchens. It is not an ingredient used in domestic cooking or found in a typical Indian pantry for preparing meals from scratch. Its role is exclusively within the industrial food processing domain, where it serves as a functional additive rather than a direct culinary component that contributes flavour, texture, or nutritional value to home-cooked dishes.

In the industrial food sector, INS 1520 is a highly valued multi-functional additive. Primarily, it acts as a diluent, solvent, and carrier for flavourings, food colours, and enzyme preparations, ensuring their uniform dispersion and stability within a product matrix. Its humectant properties help retain moisture in products like baked goods and confectionery, thereby extending shelf life and maintaining desirable textures. As a dispersing agent or flour treatment agent, it facilitates the even distribution of other active ingredients in complex food formulations. It is extensively used across a wide range of FMCG products, including beverages, processed snacks, bakery items, and confectionery, where it contributes to product consistency, sensory attributes, and overall quality.

Consumers often encounter "Diluent (INS 1520)" on ingredient lists without a clear understanding of its function, sometimes leading to a general apprehension towards "chemicals" in food. It is vital to differentiate food-grade Propylene Glycol (INS 1520), which is approved for consumption, from the highly toxic Ethylene Glycol, used in industrial applications like antifreeze. INS 1520's primary role is as a safe solvent or carrier, reducing the concentration of other substances to make them easier to handle and uniformly incorporate, rather than acting as a flavouring agent or a nutritional component itself.
