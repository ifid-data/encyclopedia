Sourdough, a venerable method of natural leavening, traces its origins back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, predating the use of commercial yeast by millennia. It is essentially a symbiotic culture of wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, cultivated in a flour and water mixture known as a "starter." While not indigenous to traditional Indian culinary practices, sourdough has seen a significant resurgence and adoption in modern Indian artisanal bakeries and health-conscious home kitchens, particularly in metropolitan areas. Its appeal lies in its natural fermentation process, which aligns with a growing interest in traditional and gut-friendly foods. The starter, often passed down through generations or shared within communities, is the living heart of sourdough baking.

In home kitchens, sourdough is primarily used to leaven bread, imparting a distinctive tangy flavour, a chewy crumb, and a crisp crust. The slow fermentation process breaks down complex carbohydrates and proteins in flour, potentially enhancing nutrient availability and digestibility. Beyond bread, home bakers in India are experimenting with sourdough for a variety of applications, including pancakes, waffles, pizza bases, and even traditional Indian flatbreads like kulchas, offering a unique twist on familiar dishes. The maintenance of a live sourdough starter, requiring regular feeding, is a ritual that connects bakers to an ancient culinary tradition.

Industrially, sourdough finds application in the FMCG sector, particularly in premium and health-oriented baked goods. "Sourdough powder" represents a processed form, where the active starter is dried, often to be used as a flavouring agent, a dough conditioner, or a natural leavening component in conjunction with commercial yeast. This powdered form offers the characteristic sourdough flavour and some of its functional benefits, such as improved texture and extended shelf life, without the logistical challenges of managing a live culture in large-scale production. It is incorporated into a range of products, from packaged breads and crackers to specialty biscuits, catering to consumer demand for natural and artisanal profiles.

A common point of confusion arises between a live "sourdough" starter and "sourdough powder." The former is a dynamic, active culture of wild yeasts and bacteria that requires continuous feeding and provides the primary leavening power and complex flavour development in traditional sourdough baking. Sourdough powder, on the other hand, is a dried, often inactive or partially active product derived from sourdough. While it contributes flavour and can improve dough characteristics, it typically does not possess the full leavening capacity of a live starter and may require the addition of commercial yeast for adequate rise. It is also distinct from commercial baker's yeast, which is a single, fast-acting strain of yeast.
