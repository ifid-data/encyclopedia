Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid, the most abundant free amino acid in the human body, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes. While not traditionally sourced as a standalone ingredient in Indian culinary heritage, its presence is inherent in protein-rich foods that form the bedrock of Indian diets, such as dals, paneer, milk, and various meats. Its scientific discovery dates back to the early 20th century, and its significance in metabolism and cellular function has been increasingly recognized, leading to its prominence in modern nutritional science and the burgeoning Indian nutraceutical market.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, glutamine is not used as a direct culinary ingredient for flavour or texture. Instead, it is consumed naturally as part of a balanced diet rich in protein sources. Foods like lentils (dals), dairy products (paneer, curd), and animal proteins (chicken, fish) are integral to Indian meals and provide the body with the necessary amino acids, including glutamine, for daily functions. Its role here is purely nutritional, absorbed and utilized by the body from whole food sources.

Industrially and in modern applications, glutamine, particularly in its L-glutamine form, is a cornerstone of the sports nutrition and health supplement industry in India. It is widely used in dietary supplements aimed at muscle recovery, reducing exercise-induced fatigue, and supporting immune function, especially among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Glutamine peptides, a more stable and potentially bioavailable form, are also utilized in some formulations, offering advantages in absorption and stability compared to the free-form L-glutamine. Beyond sports, it finds application in medical nutrition, particularly for patients with compromised gut health or those undergoing intense physical stress, due to its vital role in intestinal integrity and immune cell function.

A common point of confusion arises from the various forms of glutamine available. Consumers often conflate "glutamine" (referring generally to the amino acid) with "L-glutamine" (the biologically active isomer predominantly used in supplements) and "glutamine peptides" (glutamine bound to other amino acids, often marketed for enhanced absorption). While L-glutamine is the most common supplemental form, glutamine peptides are sometimes preferred for their stability and potential benefits for gut health. It is also crucial to distinguish glutamine from general protein supplements; while protein provides all amino acids, glutamine is a specific amino acid with targeted functional benefits, not a complete protein source itself.
