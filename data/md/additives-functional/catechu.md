# Catechu

Catechu, known colloquially as *katha* (from which its synonym *kathodi* derives), is a concentrated extract derived from the heartwood of the *Acacia catechu* tree, indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Historically, its use in India dates back millennia, deeply embedded in Ayurvedic traditions for its medicinal properties and as a natural dye and tanning agent. The tree, often referred to as the "khair" tree, thrives in the dry deciduous forests across states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, where its wood is sustainably harvested for extraction. The process involves boiling wood chips in water, concentrating the decoction, and allowing it to solidify into a brittle, reddish-brown mass.

In traditional Indian homes, catechu is almost exclusively recognized for its indispensable role in *paan* (betel quid). It imparts a characteristic reddish-brown hue and a distinct astringent, slightly bitter taste, balancing the other ingredients like betel leaf, areca nut (supari), and slaked lime (chuna). Beyond its culinary-cultural application in paan, catechu is not typically used as a standalone spice in everyday cooking. However, its historical use in traditional medicine as an astringent, antiseptic, and digestive aid meant it was often prepared in various forms for therapeutic consumption.

Industrially, catechu finds applications primarily as a natural colorant and a functional ingredient. Its rich brown pigment is utilized in some food and beverage formulations, though less commonly than synthetic alternatives. More significantly, its high tannin content makes it valuable in the leather industry as a tanning agent and in textile dyeing. In modern nutraceuticals, catechu extracts are sometimes incorporated for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, leveraging its traditional Ayurvedic reputation. Its functional properties, rather than its flavour, drive its industrial utility.

Consumers often encounter catechu primarily as "katha" in paan shops, leading to a common misconception that it is merely a flavouring agent. It is crucial to distinguish catechu from other paan components like the mildly psychoactive areca nut or the alkaline slaked lime; catechu's role is primarily as an astringent and colorant. Furthermore, while "catechu" is a broad term, the Indian context predominantly refers to "black catechu" from *Acacia catechu*, which is distinct from "pale catechu" or "gambier" derived from *Uncaria gambir*, a different plant species with similar but not identical properties.
