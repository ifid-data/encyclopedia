# Wheat Gluten

Wheat gluten is a complex of proteins, primarily gliadin and glutenin, naturally present in wheat and related grains like barley and rye. Historically, its functional properties have been leveraged implicitly in Indian cuisine through the extensive use of wheat flour for staples like *roti*, *chapati*, *puri*, and *naan*. While not traditionally extracted and used as a standalone ingredient in home kitchens, the concept of gluten's elasticity and structure has been central to the texture of these beloved breads. Globally, its isolation dates back centuries, particularly in East Asian vegetarian traditions where it forms the basis of "seitan" or "wheat meat." In India, wheat is a major crop, especially in the northern states, providing the raw material for this protein.

In traditional Indian home cooking, wheat gluten's role is inherent in the flour itself, contributing to the characteristic chewiness and elasticity of doughs. It allows *rotis* to puff up and *naans* to achieve their signature texture. While not a direct ingredient added by homemakers, its presence is fundamental to the success of countless wheat-based dishes. With the rise of global culinary influences and dietary trends, some modern Indian home cooks might experiment with vital wheat gluten as a dough enhancer for artisanal breads or as a base for plant-based meat alternatives.

Industrially, vital wheat gluten is a highly valued functional ingredient in the Indian food processing sector. Its unique viscoelastic properties make it indispensable in the production of baked goods, where it improves dough strength, elasticity, and gas retention, leading to better volume and crumb structure in commercial breads, biscuits, and cakes. It is also widely used in fortified flours, pasta, breakfast cereals, and as a binding agent and protein enhancer in various processed foods. Its ability to mimic meat textures makes it a key component in the burgeoning market for vegetarian and vegan meat analogues, catering to a growing consumer base seeking plant-based protein options.

Consumers often encounter "wheat gluten" in various forms, leading to some confusion. "Vital gluten" or "vital wheat protein" are common commercial terms for the dried, processed form of wheat gluten, known for its high protein content and functional properties. It is crucial to understand that "gluten" specifically refers to the protein complex found in wheat, barley, and rye. Therefore, terms like "sunflower gluten" are misnomers; while sunflower seeds contain protein, it is not the same gluten complex that triggers sensitivities in individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. The primary distinction for many is between foods containing wheat gluten and "gluten-free" alternatives, which are specifically formulated to exclude this protein.
