## Flavour Enhancer

The concept of enhancing flavour is ancient in India, achieved through slow cooking, fermentation, and naturally glutamate-rich ingredients. However, "Flavour Enhancer" as a distinct food additive, particularly Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, INS 621), has a more recent history. MSG was isolated in 1908 by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda from kombu seaweed, identifying "umami." Its introduction to India paralleled the rise of processed foods and Indo-Chinese cuisine. Unlike agricultural products, enhancers like MSG are manufactured through fermentation of carbohydrate sources such as molasses or starch.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, isolated flavour enhancers are not historically used. Instead, rich, complex flavours are developed through time-honoured techniques. Long simmering of curries and dals, careful layering of spices, fermented batters for idli and dosa, and ingredients like ripe tomatoes, onions, and garlic all naturally contribute to a heightened flavour profile by releasing glutamates. While not traditional, MSG has found its way into some modern home cooking, particularly in dishes replicating restaurant-style Indo-Chinese preparations.

Flavour enhancers are indispensable in the modern Indian food industry, critical for a vast array of FMCG products. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, INS 621) is widely used in instant noodles, snack foods, soups, sauces, and ready-to-eat meals to impart savory "umami" depth. Disodium Inosinate (INS 631) and Disodium Guanylate (INS 627) are often used synergistically with MSG to amplify umami perception. Enzymes like proteases (INS 1101) also function as enhancers. These additives are crucial for restoring flavour lost during processing, enhancing palatability, and creating a satisfying taste experience, especially in products with reduced fat or salt.

A common confusion distinguishes "flavour enhancers" from "flavouring agents." While flavouring agents (e.g., vanilla) impart a specific taste, enhancers intensify the inherent taste of the food itself, primarily boosting umami perception. The most significant public misconception surrounds Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, INS 621). Often erroneously perceived as an artificial chemical, MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, a naturally occurring amino acid abundant in foods like cheese and tomatoes. Despite historical controversies, major food safety authorities worldwide, including FSSAI, recognize MSG as safe for consumption, dispelling myths about its adverse effects.
