**Pectin (INS 440)**

Pectin, a naturally occurring heteropolysaccharide, is an integral component of plant cell walls, particularly abundant in the peels and pulp of citrus fruits and apples. Its gelling properties have been implicitly understood and harnessed in traditional Indian culinary practices for centuries, long before its scientific isolation in the early 19th century. While not a cultivated crop, the raw materials for commercial pectin—citrus peels and apple pomace—are by-products of fruit processing industries globally, with India being a significant consumer of pectin in its food manufacturing sector.

In Indian home kitchens, pectin's presence is crucial for the traditional preparation of fruit preserves like *murabbas* (fruit preserves), *chutneys*, and *jams*. Homemakers intuitively select fruits high in natural pectin, such as unripe guavas, certain varieties of apples, or add acidic agents like lemon juice, to achieve the desired set and texture without needing to add commercial pectin. This reliance on the inherent properties of fruits underscores a deep-rooted understanding of food science within traditional Indian cooking.

As a food additive (INS 440), pectin is a versatile hydrocolloid widely employed in the modern food industry. Its primary function is as a gelling agent, indispensable for the consistent production of jams, jellies, fruit fillings, and confectionery. Beyond gelling, it acts as a thickener in yogurts, fruit preparations, and sauces, enhancing viscosity and mouthfeel. Furthermore, pectin serves as a stabilizer, preventing syneresis (water separation) in dairy products and fruit juices, thereby extending shelf life and maintaining product quality. It can also contribute to emulsion stability in certain complex formulations.

Consumers often encounter pectin in two forms: naturally present in fruits and as an added ingredient (INS 440). The key distinction lies in its application: while fruits inherently contain pectin, commercial pectin is an extracted, purified form used to ensure reliable and consistent gelling, especially when working with fruits low in natural pectin or when specific textural attributes are required. It is distinct from other gelling agents like agar (INS 406), derived from seaweed, or gelatin (INS 428), an animal-derived protein, each possessing unique gelling mechanisms and textural outcomes.
