Ammonia (NH₃), a pungent compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, derives its name from "sal ammoniac" (ammonium chloride), first prepared near the temple of the Egyptian god Amun. While known since antiquity, its large-scale industrial synthesis became feasible with the Haber-Bosch process in the early 20th century, revolutionizing agriculture through fertilizer production. In India, ammonia is not a cultivated ingredient but a fundamental industrial chemical, produced and utilized extensively across various sectors. Its presence in the Indian food system is primarily through its derivatives, which are manufactured for specific applications.

Direct gaseous ammonia or concentrated ammonium hydroxide is not a component of traditional Indian home cooking due to its caustic nature and strong odour. However, its derivative, ammonium bicarbonate, historically known as "hartshorn" or "baking ammonia," found niche applications. It was occasionally used as a leavening agent in certain crisp, thin baked goods like traditional biscuits and crackers, particularly in European-influenced recipes that made their way to India. Its advantage was that it completely volatilized during baking, leaving no alkaline residue, unlike baking soda. Modern Indian home kitchens rarely employ it, preferring more readily available and less odorous leavening agents.

In the modern Indian food industry, ammonium bicarbonate (INS 503(ii)) remains a significant leavening agent, especially in the production of commercial biscuits, crackers, and some confectionery items. Its ability to produce a very crisp texture and its complete decomposition into gaseous products (ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water) during baking makes it ideal for products where minimal residual taste is desired. Ammonium hydroxide (INS 527) also serves as a pH regulator and processing aid in certain food preparations, though its use is carefully controlled. Beyond food, ammonia is indispensable in India for manufacturing fertilizers, refrigerants, and various cleaning products.

A common point of confusion arises from the terms "ammonia" and "ammonium hydroxide." Ammonia (NH₃) refers to the gas, while ammonium hydroxide is its aqueous solution (NH₃ dissolved in water), often referred to simply as "ammonia solution." In food applications, neither is typically used directly in its concentrated form. Instead, the solid salt, ammonium bicarbonate, is the primary food-grade derivative employed as a leavening agent. It is crucial to differentiate food-grade ammonium compounds, which are safe when used correctly, from the highly concentrated and toxic industrial or household cleaning ammonia, which is never intended for consumption.
