### Amino Acids

Amino acids are the fundamental organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins, essential for virtually all biological processes in living organisms. Their discovery dates back to the early 19th century, with asparagine being the first identified in 1806. In India, while not historically recognized as isolated compounds, the concept of protein-rich foods and their vital role in diet has been ingrained in traditional culinary and Ayurvedic practices for millennia. Sourcing of amino acids for industrial applications primarily involves the hydrolysis of plant or animal proteins, microbial fermentation, or chemical synthesis, making them globally available.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, amino acids are not used as standalone ingredients but are inherently present in every protein-rich food item. The diverse and balanced nature of Indian cuisine, incorporating a wide array of dals (lentils), grains, dairy, nuts, and sometimes meat, naturally ensures a comprehensive intake of various amino acids. They contribute significantly to the flavour profile of many dishes, with glutamate, for instance, being a key component of the umami taste found in fermented foods, aged cheeses, and slow-cooked gravies.

Industrially, amino acids find extensive applications in the modern food system. They are crucial in food fortification, particularly lysine, which is often added to cereal-based products to enhance their nutritional completeness. Specific amino acids like branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are popular as dietary supplements for athletes and individuals with specific nutritional needs. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a salt of glutamic acid, is widely used as a flavour enhancer in processed foods and snacks. Furthermore, amino acids are vital components in infant formulas, medical nutrition products, and animal feed formulations.

A common point of confusion arises between "amino acids" and "protein." It is crucial to understand that amino acids are the individual units that link together to form complex protein molecules. While proteins are large macromolecules, amino acids are their smaller, digestible components. Another distinction lies between "essential" amino acids, which the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained through diet, and "non-essential" amino acids, which the body can produce. A well-balanced Indian diet, rich in diverse protein sources, typically provides all the necessary essential amino acids without the need for isolated supplementation.
