# Indigo Carmine Ins 132

**Indigo Carmine (INS 132)**

Indigo Carmine, identified by the international food additive number INS 132, is a synthetic blue dye widely used in the food industry. Unlike many traditional Indian ingredients with ancient roots, Indigo Carmine is a product of modern chemistry, developed to provide a consistent and vibrant blue hue. Its introduction to India, like other synthetic food colours, came with the rise of processed foods and the need for standardized visual appeal. As a synthetic compound, it is not sourced from agricultural regions but manufactured through chemical synthesis, ensuring purity and consistent colour strength, which natural blue pigments often struggle to achieve.

In the context of Indian culinary traditions, Indigo Carmine holds no place in home kitchens or traditional cooking practices. Indian cuisine historically relies on natural colours derived from spices like turmeric, saffron, or beetroot, or the inherent colours of ingredients themselves. Therefore, one would not find Indigo Carmine being used for tempering, frying, or any other conventional cooking method in a typical Indian household, where the emphasis remains on natural flavours and colours.

However, Indigo Carmine finds extensive application in the industrial food sector and modern FMCG products across India. Its excellent stability to heat and light, coupled with its intense blue shade, makes it a preferred choice for colouring confectionery, baked goods, dairy products, beverages, and certain processed snacks. Food technologists utilize it to achieve specific blue shades in items like ice creams, sweets, and soft drinks. The "lake" form, such as Blue 2 Lake, is particularly valuable for fat-based products, coatings, or dry mixes where the water-soluble dye might bleed or not disperse effectively, providing a stable, non-migratory colour.

Consumers often encounter Indigo Carmine without realizing its specific form. A common point of confusion arises between Indigo Carmine (the water-soluble dye) and its "lake" variants (e.g., Blue 2 Lake). While both impart a blue colour, the former is a dye that dissolves in water, ideal for aqueous solutions, whereas the latter is an insoluble pigment formed by adsorbing the dye onto an inert substrate like alumina. This lake form is crucial for applications requiring colour stability in fats or for surface coatings. It is also important to distinguish synthetic colours like Indigo Carmine from natural blue alternatives, such as spirulina extract or anthocyanins, which, despite being natural, possess different functional properties and regulatory considerations.
