**Khar**

Khar, an ancient alkaline salt, holds a significant place in India's culinary heritage, particularly in traditional snack preparation. The term "khar" itself, meaning alkaline or salty in various Indian languages, points to its fundamental nature. Historically, khar was sourced from the ashes of specific plants, such as banana stems or certain grasses, which were leached with water to extract the alkaline salts. This traditional method of preparation, often a household practice, predates the widespread availability of modern leavening agents. Today, while still available in its traditional form, commercial khar is often a refined mineral salt, typically a blend of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, sometimes with traces of sodium bicarbonate. Its use is deeply embedded in regional culinary practices, especially across Western and Eastern India.

In home kitchens, khar is most famously known as "papad khar," an indispensable ingredient in the making of papads—thin, crisp lentil or rice wafers. Its unique alkaline properties are crucial for imparting the characteristic crispness, aiding in the dough's elasticity, and contributing to the distinctive texture and subtle flavour profile of papads. Beyond papads, khar finds application in certain regional dishes, particularly in Bengali cuisine (e.g., in some vegetable preparations) and parts of North-Eastern India, where it is valued for its tenderizing effects on vegetables or meats and its ability to achieve specific textural qualities in stews and curries.

While modern food industries often opt for standardized leavening agents like sodium bicarbonate or baking powder due to their consistent composition and controlled reactions, khar retains its niche in the industrial production of traditional Indian snacks. Small-scale and artisanal manufacturers of papads and specific regional savouries continue to utilize khar to preserve the authentic taste, texture, and mouthfeel that consumers associate with these heritage products. Its functional properties—primarily alkalinity, tenderizing, and crisping—are critical for replicating the traditional characteristics, though in larger FMCG operations, these effects might be achieved through a combination of other approved food additives.

A common point of confusion arises in distinguishing khar from other leavening agents like baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) or baking powder. While all are alkaline, khar is typically a more potent alkaline mixture, often comprising sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, making it distinct from pure sodium bicarbonate. It is not a direct substitute for baking soda; its specific chemical composition and traditional application yield a unique texture and flavour profile, particularly in papads, that baking soda alone cannot replicate. Furthermore, khar is fundamentally different from common table salt (sodium chloride), as its primary role is functional (texture modification, pH adjustment) rather than merely seasoning.
