## Flavouring

Flavourings are substances, or mixtures of substances, added to food to impart or modify its aroma and/or taste. While the concept of flavouring food is as ancient as cuisine itself, deeply rooted in India's millennia-old use of spices, herbs, and aromatics, the modern industrial application of concentrated flavourings is a more recent development. Traditional Indian culinary practices rely on whole ingredients like cardamom, saffron, rose petals, and kewra for their inherent flavour profiles. The term "essence" (derived from the Latin *essentia*), referring to concentrated extracts, became more common with the advent of global trade and processing techniques.

In the Indian home kitchen, the primary source of flavour remains fresh, whole ingredients and traditional spice blends. However, concentrated essences, particularly those of vanilla, rose, kewra, and pineapple, have found a cherished place in the preparation of sweets, desserts, and beverages. Rose essence is indispensable in *gulab jamun* and *sherbets*, while kewra lends its distinctive floral note to *biryanis* and *kheer*. Vanilla essence is a staple for baking cakes and puddings, reflecting a blend of traditional and adopted culinary practices.

Industrially, flavourings are indispensable to the Indian Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. They are crucial for creating consistent and appealing taste profiles across a vast range of products, from savoury snacks (like chips and *namkeen*) and instant noodles to confectionery, beverages, and dairy products. Flavourings in powder form are widely used in seasoning sachets for snacks and instant mixes, while liquid essences are prevalent in drinks, ice creams, and baked goods. They serve to enhance natural flavours, mask undesirable notes, and provide a sensory experience that might be difficult or costly to achieve with whole ingredients alone.

A common area of confusion surrounds the different classifications of flavourings. "Natural flavourings" are derived from natural sources (plant, animal, or microbial) through physical, enzymatic, or microbiological processes. "Nature-identical flavourings" are chemically identical to substances found in nature but are produced synthetically. "Artificial flavourings," conversely, are entirely synthetic compounds that may not have a natural counterpart. It is crucial to distinguish these concentrated flavouring agents from the actual ingredients they mimic (e.g., "mango flavouring" versus actual mango pulp), as flavourings primarily contribute sensory attributes without necessarily offering the nutritional or textural benefits of the original foodstuff.
