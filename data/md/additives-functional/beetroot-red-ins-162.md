Beetroot Red (INS 162) is a natural food colorant derived from the root of the common beetroot, *Beta vulgaris*. While the beetroot itself has ancient origins, cultivated for millennia across various civilizations for its nutritional value, its industrial extraction as a pure colorant is a more modern development. In India, beetroot, known as "chukandar" in Hindi, is widely grown, particularly in cooler climates, and is a common vegetable in home kitchens. The vibrant red-purple pigments, primarily betalains (specifically betacyanins like betanin), are responsible for its characteristic hue.

In traditional Indian home cooking, beetroot is not typically used as an isolated colorant but rather incorporated whole or grated into dishes to impart both color and flavor. It finds its way into salads, raitas, juices, and even some curries or rice preparations, lending a natural, earthy sweetness along with its striking visual appeal. Its direct use in this manner reflects a holistic approach to ingredients, where the entire vegetable contributes to the dish's sensory profile.

Industrially, Beetroot Red (INS 162) is a highly valued natural additive in the FMCG sector. It is extensively used in products such as yogurts, ice creams, confectionery, beverages, sauces, and processed foods to achieve shades ranging from pink to red-violet. Its appeal stems from consumer demand for "clean label" ingredients and natural alternatives to synthetic dyes. However, its application requires careful consideration as betalains are sensitive to heat, light, and pH variations, which can lead to color degradation during processing or storage. Food technologists often employ encapsulation or blend it with stabilizers to enhance its stability in various food matrices.

Consumers often encounter Beetroot Red (INS 162) on ingredient labels and may confuse it with other red colorants. It is crucial to distinguish it from synthetic azo dyes like Ponceau 4R (INS 124) or Allura Red (INS 129), which are chemically synthesized and offer greater stability and intensity but lack the natural origin. Furthermore, while other natural red pigments exist, such as anthocyanins (from berries or hibiscus) or paprika extract, Beetroot Red provides a distinct purplish-red hue and a different stability profile, making it a unique and sought-after natural coloring agent in the food industry.
