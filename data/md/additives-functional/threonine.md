### Threonine

Threonine is an alpha-amino acid, one of the twenty common amino acids found in proteins, and crucially, one of the nine essential amino acids for humans. Discovered in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, it was the last of the common proteinogenic amino acids to be identified. Unlike many other nutrients, threonine is not "sourced" from a specific plant or region in the traditional sense; rather, it is an inherent component of proteins found across a wide array of foods. Its significance lies in its indispensable role in human metabolism, as the body cannot synthesize it and thus it must be obtained through dietary intake.

In Indian home kitchens, threonine is not used as a standalone ingredient for cooking. Instead, it is naturally present in the protein-rich foods that form the backbone of traditional Indian diets. Lentils (dals), milk and dairy products, eggs, poultry, fish, and various nuts and seeds are all natural sources of threonine. Its presence contributes to the overall nutritional value of meals, supporting the body's protein synthesis when these diverse food groups are consumed as part of a balanced diet, often in combinations that ensure a complete amino acid profile.

Industrially, threonine finds significant application, particularly in the health and nutrition sector. It is a common ingredient in dietary supplements, protein powders, and fortified food products, especially those aimed at athletes or individuals with specific nutritional needs. Given the rise of plant-based diets, threonine is also used to fortify plant-derived protein sources, ensuring they provide a complete amino acid profile comparable to animal proteins. Beyond human nutrition, it is widely utilized in the animal feed industry to balance the amino acid content of livestock and poultry diets, promoting growth and health.

A common point of confusion for consumers often lies in distinguishing between essential and non-essential amino acids, or understanding the role of individual amino acids versus whole proteins. Threonine is an *essential* amino acid, meaning the human body cannot produce it and it must be acquired through diet. This differentiates it from *non-essential* amino acids, which the body can synthesize. It is a fundamental building block of protein, not a macronutrient like carbohydrates or fats, and its primary function is to contribute to the structural and functional integrity of proteins within the body, playing roles in collagen, elastin, and antibody formation.
