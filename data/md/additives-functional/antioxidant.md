### Antioxidant

The principle of preventing food spoilage, which antioxidants facilitate, has ancient roots in Indian culinary practices like pickling and the use of preservative spices. However, the scientific understanding and deliberate addition of isolated antioxidant compounds are modern developments. Natural antioxidants like Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) are abundant in Indian fruits such as amla and citrus, while Vitamin E (tocopherols) is found in vegetable oils. Synthetic antioxidants such as Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA, INS 320) and Tertiary Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ, INS 319) are chemically synthesized for stable, effective preservation in industrial food production. Rosemary extract (INS 392) offers a natural, plant-derived alternative.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, direct addition of isolated antioxidant additives is uncommon. Instead, the inherent antioxidant properties of various ingredients are leveraged. Lemon juice (rich in Vitamin C), for instance, is often added to cut fruits or vegetables to prevent enzymatic browning. Spices like turmeric, cloves, and cinnamon, integral to Indian cooking, contain natural antioxidant compounds that contribute to both flavour and preservation. Traditional cooking methods and fresh ingredients naturally incorporate these protective elements, extending freshness without synthetic intervention.

Antioxidants are indispensable in the modern Indian food industry, critical for extending shelf life and maintaining quality across processed foods. They primarily inhibit oxidation, preventing rancidity in fats/oils, discoloration, and nutrient loss. Synthetic antioxidants like BHA (INS 320) and TBHQ (INS 319) are widely employed in snack foods (namkeen), edible oils, and processed meats due to their high efficacy. Natural antioxidants such as tocopherols (Vitamin E, INS 306/307b) are favoured in fortified oils, dairy, and infant formulas. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, INS 300) and its derivatives (e.g., sodium ascorbate, INS 301) are used in beverages, fruit preparations, and baked goods to prevent browning and preserve colour and nutritional value.

A common confusion stems from the broad term "antioxidant." Consumers often conflate naturally occurring antioxidants in whole foods (e.g., polyphenols in green tea, carotenoids in carrots) with specific antioxidant additives used in processed foods. It's crucial to understand that "Antioxidant" is a functional class, not a single ingredient. These additives can be synthetic (like BHA, TBHQ) or derived from natural sources (like Vitamin C, Vitamin E, rosemary extract). While both prevent oxidation, their chemical structures, efficacy, and regulatory approvals (INS numbers) differ, leading to varied applications across the food industry.
