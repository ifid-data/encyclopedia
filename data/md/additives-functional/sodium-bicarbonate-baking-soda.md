# Sodium Bicarbonate Baking Soda

**Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda)**

Sodium Bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO₃. While its use as a leavening agent gained prominence with the advent of modern chemistry, its precursor, natron (a naturally occurring mineral mixture primarily of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate), was utilized by ancient Egyptians for cleaning and mummification. The industrial production of pure sodium bicarbonate began in the 19th century, notably through the Solvay process. In India, its widespread adoption coincided with the popularization of Western baking techniques and the availability of commercially produced leavening agents, becoming an indispensable ingredient in both traditional and modern kitchens.

In Indian home cooking, sodium bicarbonate serves multiple culinary purposes. Primarily, it acts as a leavening agent, reacting with acidic ingredients (like curd, lemon juice, or vinegar) to produce carbon dioxide gas, which gives a light, airy texture to dishes. It is crucial in preparing popular snacks like *dhokla*, *pakoras*, and *bhature*, contributing to their characteristic puffiness and crispness. Beyond leavening, it is also used as a tenderizer for legumes such as *chana* (chickpeas) and *rajma* (kidney beans), reducing cooking time and improving texture. Additionally, it can be employed to neutralize excess acidity in certain preparations.

Industrially, sodium bicarbonate (INS 500) is a ubiquitous additive in the FMCG sector. As a leavening agent, it is a key component in packaged cakes, biscuits, cookies, and various instant mixes, ensuring consistent rise and texture. Its role as an acidity regulator (INS 500(i) or INS 500(ii)) is vital in processed foods and beverages, where it helps stabilize pH, control tartness, and extend shelf life. It is also found in effervescent tablets, antacids, and some carbonated drinks, leveraging its gas-producing properties.

A common point of confusion arises between "baking soda" and "baking powder." While both are leavening agents, baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and requires an acidic ingredient to activate its gas-producing reaction. In contrast, baking powder is a complete leavening system, containing sodium bicarbonate, an acid (like cream of tartar), and a starch filler, meaning it only needs moisture and/or heat to react. Sodium bicarbonate is also distinct from "washing soda" (sodium carbonate), which is a stronger alkali used for cleaning and not for culinary purposes.
