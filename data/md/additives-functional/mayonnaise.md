### Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy, and stable emulsion, primarily composed of vegetable oil, egg yolk (or a plant-based emulsifier), and an acid, typically vinegar or lemon juice, seasoned with salt and sometimes mustard. Its origins are debated, with claims from both French and Spanish culinary traditions, often linked to the 18th-century Battle of Mahón. Introduced to India largely through Western culinary influences and the advent of fast food culture in the late 20th century, mayonnaise has rapidly integrated into modern Indian diets. While not indigenous, its industrial production in India has grown significantly, with local brands now dominating the market alongside international players, sourcing vegetable oils and other ingredients domestically.

In Indian home kitchens, mayonnaise has found versatile applications, primarily as a spread for sandwiches and wraps, a dressing for salads like coleslaw and potato salad, and a dip for various snacks such as French fries, pakoras, or even parathas. Its creamy texture and tangy flavour offer a convenient way to enhance dishes, often adapted into fusion recipes like mayonnaise-based tandoori marinades or creamy vegetable preparations, reflecting a blend of global and local tastes.

Industrially, mayonnaise is a staple in the FMCG sector, widely used in ready-to-eat meals, processed snacks, and as a key ingredient in fast-food offerings like burgers, subs, and wraps. The Indian market, in particular, has seen a surge in demand for eggless mayonnaise, which utilizes plant-based emulsifiers such as milk proteins, soy proteins, or hydrocolloids to cater to the large vegetarian population. This innovation ensures the desired texture and stability without animal products, while various flavoured variants like mint, tandoori, or peri-peri mayonnaise are developed to appeal to diverse Indian palates.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the composition and types of mayonnaise available. Fundamentally, mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion, distinguished by its high oil content and the emulsifying action of egg yolks or their plant-based substitutes. In India, the primary distinction is between traditional egg-based mayonnaise and the widely popular eggless versions, which are crucial for vegetarian households. It is also distinct from other creamy sauces or salad creams, which typically have a lower oil content, different emulsifiers, and a tangier, less rich flavour profile.
