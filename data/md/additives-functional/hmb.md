**HMB**

HMB, or calcium β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate monohydrate, is a naturally occurring metabolite of the essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) leucine. While leucine is widely recognized for its role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis, HMB was identified in the 1980s as a key compound responsible for some of leucine's anti-catabolic effects, meaning it helps prevent muscle breakdown. It is not a traditional ingredient in Indian cuisine or ancient Ayurvedic texts, but rather a modern nutritional supplement, typically synthesized as a calcium salt (CaHMB) for stability and bioavailability. Its scientific discovery and subsequent application are rooted in Western sports science, with its introduction to India primarily through the global supplement market.

Unlike traditional Indian culinary ingredients, HMB has no historical or home kitchen usage in India. It is not a spice, grain, or fat used in daily cooking, nor is it part of any traditional remedies. Instead, it is consumed as a dietary supplement, often mixed into water, juice, or protein shakes. Its purpose is purely functional, aimed at physiological benefits rather than flavour, aroma, or texture in food preparation. Therefore, it does not feature in the rich tapestry of Indian home cooking or traditional food practices.

In industrial and modern applications, HMB is a prominent ingredient in the sports nutrition and functional food sectors. It is widely incorporated into dietary supplements such as powders, capsules, and ready-to-drink beverages targeting athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts. Its primary functional benefits include enhancing muscle recovery, reducing exercise-induced muscle damage, increasing lean muscle mass, and improving strength, particularly during periods of intense training or calorie restriction. Beyond sports, HMB is also being explored for its potential in clinical nutrition to combat muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in the elderly or in individuals with chronic diseases, finding its way into specialized medical food formulations.

Consumers often encounter HMB in the context of other amino acids or protein supplements, leading to some confusion. It is crucial to understand that HMB is not a protein source itself, nor is it simply another amino acid like leucine. While derived from leucine, HMB acts through distinct mechanisms, primarily by inhibiting protein degradation and supporting muscle cell membrane integrity, rather than directly stimulating protein synthesis to the same extent as leucine. Therefore, it complements, rather than replaces, protein intake. It is also distinct from general muscle-building supplements, as its primary role is often more focused on muscle preservation and recovery, especially under catabolic conditions, making it a specialized functional ingredient rather than a broad-spectrum muscle builder.
