# Citric Acid Ins 330

**Citric Acid (INS 330)**

Citric acid, chemically a tricarboxylic acid, is a naturally occurring organic acid found abundantly in citrus fruits like lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits. Its discovery is attributed to the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who first isolated it from lemon juice in 1784. While historically extracted from fruit, the vast majority of citric acid used today, particularly in India, is produced industrially through the fermentation of carbohydrates by the mould *Aspergillus niger*. This method, pioneered in the early 20th century, ensures a consistent and cost-effective supply, making it one of the most widely used food additives globally.

In Indian home kitchens, citric acid powder, often referred to as "nimbu sat" (lemon salt), serves as a convenient and potent souring agent. It is frequently employed when fresh citrus is unavailable or when a concentrated, pure sourness is desired without adding liquid. Homemakers use it in preparations like *paneer* (cottage cheese) making, where its acidity helps curdle milk, in various pickles (*achaar*) for preservation and tang, and in certain *chaat* items or beverages to impart a sharp, refreshing tartness. Its crystalline powder form makes it easy to store and measure.

Industrially, citric acid (INS 330) is a cornerstone of the food and beverage sector. Its primary functions are as an acidity regulator, flavour enhancer, and antioxidant. In the FMCG space, it is indispensable in soft drinks, fruit juices, jams, jellies, candies, and processed dairy products, where it balances sweetness, provides a tart flavour profile, and extends shelf life by inhibiting microbial growth and preventing oxidation. As a chelating agent, it binds to metal ions, preventing discolouration and rancidity in fats and oils, thus acting as an effective antioxidant.

Consumers often encounter citric acid in its pure, powdered form, which can lead to confusion regarding its origin. While it is naturally present in citrus fruits, the "citric acid" listed as INS 330 on ingredient labels is almost always a product of microbial fermentation, not direct fruit extraction. It is distinct from other natural souring agents like tamarind (*imli*), dry mango powder (*amchur*), or vinegar, as it offers a clean, sharp sourness without imparting additional complex flavours or colours, making it highly versatile for precise pH adjustment and flavour control in food manufacturing.
