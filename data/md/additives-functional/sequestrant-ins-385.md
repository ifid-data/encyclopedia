### Sequestrant (INS 385)

Sequestrants, a class of food additives, play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and shelf-life of processed foods by binding to metal ions. Among these, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and its salts, particularly Calcium Disodium EDTA (INS 385), are widely utilized. Unlike ingredients sourced from nature, EDTA is a synthetic compound developed for its powerful chelating properties, meaning its ability to form stable complexes with metal ions. Its application in food science emerged from its earlier uses in industrial and medical fields, where its capacity to sequester unwanted metal ions was recognized as a valuable tool for preventing undesirable chemical reactions.

In traditional Indian home cooking, the concept of a "sequestrant" as a direct additive is virtually non-existent. Home kitchens rely on natural methods to manage food stability, such as the use of acidic ingredients like tamarind, lemon juice, or vinegar in pickles and chutneys. These natural acids can, to some extent, chelate metal ions present in food, thereby inhibiting spoilage and preserving color and flavor. However, the precise and potent chelating action of synthetic sequestrants like INS 385 is not replicated through conventional culinary practices, highlighting the distinct needs of industrial food processing.

Industrially, Calcium Disodium EDTA (INS 385) is a cornerstone in the formulation of numerous FMCG products. Its primary function is to prevent oxidative degradation, discoloration, and rancidity by sequestering trace metal ions (such as iron and copper) that act as catalysts for these reactions. It is commonly found in canned vegetables, mayonnaise, salad dressings, carbonated soft drinks, and processed seafood. By binding these metal ions, INS 385 helps preserve the natural color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, significantly extending their shelf life and ensuring product consistency and appeal for consumers.

A common point of confusion arises from the functional overlap between sequestrants and antioxidants. While INS 385 is not a primary antioxidant that directly scavenges free radicals (like Vitamin C or E), it acts as an antioxidant synergist. By removing the metal ion catalysts that initiate oxidative reactions, it effectively enhances the performance of other antioxidants and prevents spoilage. It is important to distinguish INS 385 (Calcium Disodium EDTA) from Disodium EDTA (INS 386), both being EDTA salts with similar chelating functions, though INS 385 is often preferred in food due to its calcium content, which can reduce the loss of essential minerals from the food matrix.
