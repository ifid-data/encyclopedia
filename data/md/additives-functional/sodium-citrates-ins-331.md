# Sodium Citrates Ins 331

Sodium Citrates (INS 331) are the sodium salts of citric acid, a compound naturally abundant in citrus fruits. While citric acid itself has been known and utilized for centuries, the industrial production and application of its sodium salts as food additives gained prominence with the rise of processed foods in the 20th century. These compounds are not sourced from specific Indian regions but are synthetically produced globally, including in India, for widespread use in the food industry. Their chemical stability and versatile properties make them indispensable in modern food technology.

In traditional Indian home cooking, sodium citrates are not directly used as a standalone ingredient. However, their presence is ubiquitous in many processed foods that have become staples in contemporary Indian households. For instance, they are found in packaged dairy products like processed cheese, certain instant mixes, and a variety of beverages and snacks consumed daily. While not a direct culinary additive for home cooks, their functional benefits indirectly influence the texture, shelf-life, and flavour profile of many convenience foods that complement traditional meals.

Industrially, Sodium Citrates (INS 331) serve multiple critical functions in the Indian food and beverage sector. As an acidity regulator, they help maintain a stable pH in products like soft drinks, fruit juices, and jams, preventing spoilage and preserving flavour. Their role as a stabiliser is particularly vital in dairy products; they prevent the coagulation of milk proteins during heat treatment (e.g., in evaporated milk or UHT milk) and act as emulsifying salts in processed cheese, ensuring a smooth, meltable texture. Furthermore, they function as sequestrants, binding metal ions that could otherwise cause discolouration or rancidity, thereby extending product shelf-life in a wide array of FMCG items, from namkeens to packaged desserts.

Consumers often encounter "Sodium Citrates" on ingredient labels and may confuse them with citric acid or other mineral salts. It is crucial to understand that while derived from citric acid, sodium citrates are salts and act primarily as buffering agents, meaning they resist changes in pH, unlike citric acid which directly lowers pH. They are also distinct from other acidity regulators or stabilisers, offering a unique combination of buffering, emulsifying, and sequestering properties, particularly effective in dairy and beverage applications. They are not a nutritional "mineral" in the dietary sense, but a functional additive.
