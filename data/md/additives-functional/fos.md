**FOS (Fructo-oligosaccharides)**

Fructo-oligosaccharides, commonly abbreviated as FOS, are naturally occurring carbohydrates found in a variety of plants. While the term "FOS" and its industrial application are modern, the compounds themselves have been part of the Indian diet for millennia through indigenous sources like onions, garlic, bananas, and asparagus. These plants, integral to traditional Indian culinary and medicinal practices, have always provided these beneficial compounds, albeit without specific identification in ancient texts. The scientific understanding and isolation of FOS as a distinct ingredient for functional purposes emerged in the 20th century, leading to its global recognition and subsequent introduction into the Indian food industry.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, FOS is not used as a standalone ingredient. Instead, its benefits are derived naturally from the consumption of FOS-rich vegetables and fruits that form the backbone of Indian cuisine. Onions and garlic are fundamental to countless curries, dals, and sabzis, contributing not only flavour but also their inherent FOS content. Similarly, bananas are a widely consumed fruit, and asparagus, though less common in daily cooking across all regions, is also a source. Thus, while not consciously added, FOS has always been an intrinsic part of the Indian dietary landscape through its natural presence in staple ingredients.

Industrially, FOS is highly valued as a prebiotic fibre and a low-calorie sweetener. It is widely incorporated into functional foods, dietary supplements, and health-conscious products across India. Its mild sweetness and ability to improve gut health make it a popular additive in yogurts, infant formulas, health drinks, energy bars, and certain baked goods. Food technologists utilize FOS to enhance the nutritional profile of products, offering consumers a sugar-reducing and fibre-boosting alternative without significantly altering taste or texture, aligning with the growing demand for wellness-oriented foods.

Consumers often encounter FOS and may confuse it with other types of dietary fibre or artificial sweeteners. The key distinction lies in its specific function: FOS is a *prebiotic* fibre, meaning it selectively stimulates the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the colon, unlike general dietary fibres which may offer bulk but not necessarily targeted microbial support. Furthermore, while FOS provides a mild sweetness, it is not an artificial sweetener; it is a naturally derived carbohydrate that passes undigested through the upper digestive tract, offering fewer calories than sucrose and contributing to gut health rather than just flavour.
