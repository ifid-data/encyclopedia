**Thickener**

Thickeners, as a functional class of food additives, represent a diverse group of substances used to increase the viscosity of food products without substantially altering other properties. The concept of thickening agents is ancient, with traditional Indian culinary practices long employing natural starches from grains like rice and wheat, or flours such as besan (chickpea flour), to achieve desired textures. Modern thickeners, however, are derived from a wide array of sources including plant polysaccharides (gums, starches, cellulose derivatives), microbial fermentation products, and even some proteins. Their global sourcing reflects the specific properties required, with common examples like guar gum from India, xanthan gum from microbial fermentation, and various modified starches from corn or tapioca.

In traditional Indian home cooking, thickening is often achieved through simple, natural means. Besan is a staple for thickening gravies like *kadhi* or for binding ingredients in fritters. Rice flour or cornstarch (often introduced through Indo-Chinese cuisine) are used to create smooth, glossy sauces. Reductions of coconut milk or purees of onions, tomatoes, and nuts are also fundamental to building body and richness in curries and gravies. Desserts like *kheer* (rice pudding) or *rabri* rely on the slow reduction of milk, concentrating its natural solids to achieve a thick, creamy consistency.

In the industrial food sector, thickeners are indispensable for formulating a vast range of products, from sauces, soups, and gravies to dairy products like yogurts and ice creams, and even beverages. They are crucial for imparting desirable mouthfeel, improving product stability, preventing syneresis (water separation), and suspending solid particles evenly. Modified starches, hydrocolloids like guar gum (INS 412), xanthan gum (INS 415), and cellulose gums (e.g., Carboxymethyl Cellulose, INS 466) are widely utilized. Each type offers unique rheological properties, allowing food technologists to precisely control texture, flow, and shelf-life in mass-produced items.

It is important to understand that "thickener" is a broad functional category rather than a single ingredient. Consumers often encounter the term generically on ingredient lists, sometimes accompanied by an incomplete or generic INS number, which can lead to confusion. While thickeners primarily increase viscosity, their functions often overlap with those of stabilizers (which prevent separation of ingredients) and emulsifiers (which help blend immiscible liquids like oil and water). Many hydrocolloids, for instance, can act as both thickeners and stabilizers. The specific INS number identifies the exact chemical compound, clarifying its origin and precise functional properties within the broader "thickener" class.
