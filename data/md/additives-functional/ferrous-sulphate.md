# Ferrous Sulphate

Ferrous Sulphate is an inorganic iron salt, chemically represented as FeSO₄, primarily recognized for its role as an iron supplement and fortificant. Historically, iron compounds have been used in various forms for medicinal purposes across cultures, including in traditional Indian systems, to address conditions related to weakness and blood deficiency. Ferrous sulphate itself is typically produced through chemical synthesis, often as a byproduct of steel manufacturing, rather than being sourced from agricultural produce. Its widespread use in India is largely driven by public health initiatives aimed at combating iron deficiency anemia.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, ferrous sulphate is not used as a direct culinary ingredient. Unlike spices or common food items, it does not contribute flavour, aroma, or texture to dishes. Its "culinary" application is entirely indirect, primarily through its incorporation into staple foods as part of fortification programs. For instance, it may be added to fortified atta (wheat flour) or salt, which are then used in daily cooking, thereby delivering essential iron without altering the sensory profile of the food.

Industrially, ferrous sulphate is a critical ingredient in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. As a highly bioavailable form of iron, it is extensively used in dietary supplements and for fortifying a wide range of processed foods, including cereals, infant formulas, and beverages, to address widespread iron deficiency anemia in India. The variant, encapsulated ferrous sulphate, represents a technological advancement where the iron salt is coated with a protective layer. This encapsulation helps mask the metallic taste, reduces undesirable interactions with other food components, and improves its stability and bioavailability within complex food matrices, making it ideal for sensitive applications like fortified milk or snack foods.

Consumers often encounter ferrous sulphate in fortified foods or as a standalone supplement, leading to potential confusion with other iron compounds or the broader concept of dietary iron. It is crucial to understand that ferrous sulphate is a specific chemical salt of iron, distinct from other fortificants like ferrous fumarate or ferric pyrophosphate, which may differ in bioavailability, sensory impact, or cost. The encapsulated form is not a different chemical but rather the same compound processed to enhance its functional properties within food systems, offering benefits like reduced oxidation and improved palatability compared to its unencapsulated counterpart.
