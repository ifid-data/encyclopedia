**Color (Generic)**

In the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine, the aesthetic appeal of food, often conveyed through vibrant hues, is as crucial as its flavour and aroma. Historically, India has utilized a diverse palette of natural colorants derived from indigenous spices, fruits, and vegetables. Turmeric (*haldi*) for its golden yellow, saffron (*kesar*) for its regal orange, beetroot for deep reds, and spinach for greens have been integral to traditional cooking, lending visual delight to dishes like biryanis, sweets, and curries. The Sanskrit term *varna* and Hindi *rang* encapsulate this deep cultural appreciation for colour in food, signifying not just appearance but often auspiciousness and sensory experience.

In home kitchens and traditional culinary practices across India, the use of natural colorants remains prevalent. Turmeric is ubiquitous, providing both colour and flavour to countless savoury dishes. Saffron is prized for its delicate hue and aroma in festive sweets like *kheer* and *mithai*, and in rich rice preparations. Beetroot juice is often employed to impart a natural red to *raita* or *parathas*, while extracts from plants like *palak* (spinach) can be used for green. These natural additions are valued for their perceived health benefits and the authentic character they lend to food, aligning with traditional Ayurvedic principles.

Modern food processing and the FMCG sector in India heavily rely on both natural and synthetic food colors to enhance product appeal, ensure batch consistency, and meet consumer expectations. Synthetic food colors, such as Tartrazine (yellow), Sunset Yellow (orange), and Allura Red, are widely used in confectionery, beverages, snacks, and processed foods due to their stability, intensity, and cost-effectiveness. Increasingly, there's a shift towards natural alternatives like annatto, curcumin, and anthocyanins, often derived from vegetable juice concentrates (e.g., beetroot, carrot) or vegetable carbon, especially in products targeting health-conscious consumers or premium segments. These functional forms are critical for maintaining visual quality throughout a product's shelf life.

A significant area of confusion for Indian consumers lies in distinguishing between "natural colors" and "artificial" or "synthetic food colors." While natural colors, often listed as specific extracts or concentrates (e.g., "vegetable juice concentrate for color"), are generally perceived as healthier, artificial colors, though approved by regulatory bodies like FSSAI within specified limits, often face scrutiny due to concerns about potential health impacts, particularly in children. The generic term "color" on an ingredient list can be ambiguous, encompassing a wide range of permitted substances of both plant and synthetic origin, leading to a lack of transparency for consumers trying to make informed choices about the additives in their food.
