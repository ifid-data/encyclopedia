**Yeast Extract**

Yeast extract, a versatile flavouring agent, traces its origins to the late 19th century, emerging from the burgeoning brewing industry. Derived primarily from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the same yeast species used in baking and brewing, its production involves a process called autolysis, where the yeast cells' own enzymes break down their proteins into amino acids, peptides, and nucleotides. This rich mixture is then concentrated, often into a paste or powder. While yeast itself has ancient roots in Indian culinary traditions for fermentation, yeast extract as a distinct ingredient is a modern industrial development, not traditionally sourced or produced at a household level in India.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, yeast extract is not a staple ingredient. Its complex savoury profile, however, can be found in some contemporary home cooking, particularly in fusion dishes or as an enhancer in broths, gravies, and marinades where a deep, umami flavour is desired. It can subtly elevate the taste of vegetarian and non-vegetarian preparations, adding a richness that might otherwise require prolonged cooking or multiple ingredients.

Industrially, yeast extract is a ubiquitous "flavour enhancer" (E-FLAVOUR_ENHANCER) in the Indian FMCG sector. Its powdered form (M-POWDER) is particularly valued for its ease of incorporation into dry mixes, seasonings, and coatings. It is a key ingredient in instant noodles, ready-to-eat meals, soups, sauces, and a wide array of snack foods like chips and namkeen, where it imparts a desirable savoury, umami depth. Beyond flavour, it also plays a functional role in sodium reduction strategies, allowing manufacturers to maintain palatability while lowering salt content.

A common point of confusion arises from the distinction between live yeast and yeast extract; the latter is an inactivated, processed ingredient used solely for flavour, not fermentation. Furthermore, yeast extract is often conflated with Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) due to their shared ability to impart umami. While both are flavour enhancers, yeast extract contains naturally occurring glutamates derived from the yeast cell, offering a more complex, rounded savoury profile, whereas MSG is a purified salt of glutamic acid. It is also distinct from nutritional yeast, which is an inactivated yeast product primarily consumed for its vitamin and mineral content.
