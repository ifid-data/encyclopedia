**Lycopene**

Lycopene is a vibrant red carotenoid pigment and a potent antioxidant, naturally synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Its name is derived from *Lycopersicon lycopersicum*, the scientific name for the common tomato, which is its most abundant dietary source. While not an ancient Indian ingredient in itself, lycopene has been an integral part of the Indian diet for centuries through the consumption of various red and pink fruits and vegetables. Tomatoes, introduced to India by the Portuguese in the 16th century, quickly became a culinary staple, alongside indigenous sources like watermelon, guava, and papaya, all rich in this beneficial compound.

In traditional Indian home cooking, lycopene is not used as a standalone ingredient but is consumed inherently through the generous use of its natural sources. Tomatoes form the base of countless curries, gravies, and chutneys across regional cuisines, from the tangy *rasam* of the South to the rich *makhani* gravies of the North. Watermelon and guava are popular seasonal fruits, enjoyed fresh or in simple preparations, contributing to the daily intake of this carotenoid. The cooking process, especially with a little fat, actually enhances the bioavailability of lycopene, making it more readily absorbed by the body from cooked tomato dishes.

Industrially, lycopene is highly valued for its dual role as a natural food colourant and a nutraceutical. Extracted primarily from tomatoes, it is used to impart a desirable red or orange hue to a wide array of processed foods, including sauces, soups, beverages, and confectionery, offering a natural alternative to synthetic dyes. Beyond its colouring properties, lycopene is incorporated into dietary supplements, functional foods, and cosmetics due to its strong antioxidant capabilities, which are associated with various health benefits, particularly in cardiovascular health and skin protection.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding lycopene's identity and function. It is crucial to understand that lycopene is a specific biochemical compound, not a fruit or vegetable itself, though it is derived from them. It is also frequently conflated with other carotenoids like beta-carotene, another red-orange pigment. While both are antioxidants, lycopene does not convert to Vitamin A in the body, unlike beta-carotene, and offers distinct health benefits. Furthermore, its absorption is significantly improved when consumed with dietary fats, a factor often overlooked in its nutritional assessment.
