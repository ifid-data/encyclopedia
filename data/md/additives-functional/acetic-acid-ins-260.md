### Acetic Acid (INS 260)

Acetic acid, chemically known as ethanoic acid, is a ubiquitous organic compound with a rich history deeply intertwined with human civilization. Its origins trace back to ancient times, naturally forming through the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria, a process that yields vinegar. The term "acetic" itself derives from the Latin word *acetum*, meaning vinegar. In India, the use of fermented products, including those containing acetic acid, has been a part of traditional culinary and preservation practices for millennia, though often in the form of naturally soured ingredients or fruit vinegars. While not "grown" in the conventional sense, its presence is inherent in many fermented foods and beverages across the subcontinent.

In Indian home kitchens, acetic acid is predominantly encountered as vinegar, a diluted solution typically containing 4-8% acetic acid. It is a staple for pickling (achar), where its acidic nature acts as a potent preservative, inhibiting microbial growth and imparting a characteristic tangy flavour. Vinegar is also used in marinades for meats and vegetables, in certain chutneys, and as a souring agent in some regional dishes. Its sharp, pungent profile is valued for cutting through richness and balancing flavours, particularly in street food preparations and Indo-Chinese cuisine.

Industrially, acetic acid, designated as INS 260, serves as a critical acidity regulator and preservative in a vast array of processed foods. Its ability to lower pH levels effectively inhibits the growth of spoilage microorganisms, thereby extending the shelf life of products. It is widely utilized in the manufacturing of sauces, salad dressings, ketchups, canned vegetables, and various snack foods. Beyond preservation, it contributes to flavour profiles and can act as a leavening agent in some baked goods. The industrial production of acetic acid ensures a consistent and pure form for these applications, crucial for standardized food manufacturing.

Consumers often conflate "acetic acid" with "vinegar." It is important to understand that vinegar is a diluted solution of acetic acid, typically 4-8%, along with other flavour compounds depending on its source (e.g., apple cider vinegar, white vinegar). Acetic acid (INS 260) refers to the concentrated chemical compound used as a food additive, which is far more potent than household vinegar. It is also distinct from other common food acids like citric acid (found in lemons) or lactic acid (found in dairy), each offering a unique flavour profile and functional properties, though all contribute to acidity regulation.
