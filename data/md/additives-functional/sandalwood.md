# Sandalwood

Sandalwood, known in Sanskrit as *chandana* and botanically as *Santalum album*, holds a revered place in Indian culture, history, and traditional medicine. Native to the dry deciduous forests of Southern India, particularly Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, it has been prized for millennia for its distinctive, sweet, woody aroma. Ancient Indian texts, including the Vedas and Ayurvedic treatises, extensively mention sandalwood for its spiritual, medicinal, and cosmetic properties. The most valuable part is the heartwood, which develops its characteristic fragrance over decades. Due to overharvesting, *Santalum album* is now an endangered species, leading to strict regulations on its cultivation and trade, with significant efforts in sustainable farming and plantations across India.

While primarily celebrated for its aromatic and medicinal qualities, sandalwood has a subtle, albeit niche, presence in traditional Indian culinary practices. Historically, its cooling properties made it a prized ingredient in summer beverages like sherbets, lassis, and thandai, where a minute quantity of its paste or distillate would impart a delicate fragrance and a perceived cooling effect. It was also occasionally used to flavour certain traditional sweets (mithai) and kheer, offering an exotic, earthy undertone. Its use in home kitchens is rare today, largely confined to specific regional or ceremonial preparations, often as a symbolic or aromatic garnish rather than a primary flavouring agent.

In modern food processing, sandalwood's application is predominantly as a flavouring agent, often in highly diluted natural extracts or synthetic forms, due to the scarcity and high cost of authentic *Santalum album* oil. It is occasionally found in premium confectionery, ice creams, and specialty beverages, where its unique, creamy, woody notes are desired. The "sandal safaid flavouring" seen in ingredient lists typically refers to these industrial preparations. Beyond food, its major industrial applications lie in the fragrance industry for perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and incense, as well as in aromatherapy and traditional Ayurvedic medicines, where its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties are valued.

A common point of confusion arises from the distinction between natural sandalwood (the heartwood or its pure essential oil) and "sandalwood flavouring." The latter, often listed as "distillate of sandal safaid" or "sandal safaid flavouring," is typically a highly processed extract or a synthetic compound designed to mimic the aroma profile, used for cost-effectiveness and consistency in industrial food products. Consumers should also differentiate sandalwood's role as a subtle aromatic botanical from conventional culinary spices. While both impart flavour, sandalwood's primary historical and cultural significance extends far beyond mere seasoning, encompassing spiritual, medicinal, and cosmetic realms, making its food application a specialized and often symbolic choice.
