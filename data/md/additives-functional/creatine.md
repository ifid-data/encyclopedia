## Creatine

Creatine is a naturally occurring organic acid, endogenously synthesized in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine. While not a botanical or agricultural product, its presence in the human diet is primarily through the consumption of red meat and fish. First identified in 1832 by French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, its physiological role in muscle energy metabolism was elucidated in the early 20th century. Its widespread recognition as a performance-enhancing supplement, particularly in the realm of sports and fitness, surged in the 1990s. In India, while not a traditional ingredient, its biochemical significance is understood, and it is obtained through dietary sources or, more commonly, as a manufactured supplement.

Creatine holds no direct culinary application in traditional Indian home kitchens. It is not used as a spice, flavouring agent, thickener, or primary foodstuff. Its presence in food is solely as an intrinsic component of animal products like mutton, chicken, and various fish, which are part of diverse Indian diets. Therefore, it does not feature in recipes for tempering, frying, or as a foundational element in any regional Indian cuisine.

In modern applications, creatine is predominantly utilized as a dietary supplement, particularly within the sports nutrition industry. Its primary function is to facilitate the regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's main energy currency, thereby enhancing strength, power output, and muscle endurance during high-intensity, short-duration activities. Creatine monohydrate is the most extensively researched and widely adopted form, known for its efficacy and safety. Micronized creatine monohydrate, a variant with a smaller particle size, is industrially processed to improve solubility in liquids and potentially reduce gastrointestinal discomfort for some users. It is a staple ingredient in protein powders, pre-workout formulations, and as a standalone supplement marketed across India's burgeoning fitness and wellness sector.

A common point of confusion among consumers, particularly in the Indian supplement market, lies in distinguishing between "creatine monohydrate" and "micronized creatine monohydrate." It is crucial to understand that both are chemically identical forms of creatine monohydrate. The term "micronized" simply refers to a physical processing technique where the creatine particles are ground into a much finer powder. This micronization aims to enhance mixability and dissolution in water, which can lead to quicker absorption and potentially mitigate digestive issues like bloating or stomach upset experienced by some individuals with standard creatine monohydrate. However, both forms deliver the same active compound and physiological benefits.
