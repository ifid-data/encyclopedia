**Vanilla Flavouring**

Vanilla, derived from the fruit of the vanilla orchid, primarily *Vanilla planifolia*, boasts a rich history originating in Mesoamerica, where it was revered by the Totonac people and later by the Aztecs. Introduced to India much later, vanilla cultivation is now found in states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, though the majority of vanilla flavouring used in India is either imported or synthetically produced. The name "vanilla" itself stems from the Spanish "vainilla," meaning "little pod," referring to the bean-like fruit. Its complex aroma, comprising over 200 compounds, makes it one of the most cherished and expensive spices globally.

In Indian home kitchens, vanilla flavouring is predominantly a modern addition, finding its way into Western-inspired desserts and baked goods. It is a staple in cakes, cookies, custards, and ice creams, where its warm, sweet, and slightly woody notes enhance the overall flavour profile and often mask any undesirable off-notes from other ingredients. While not traditionally part of classical Indian savoury cuisine, its use in contemporary Indian sweets and fusion desserts is growing, reflecting evolving culinary tastes and global influences.

Industrially, vanilla flavouring is ubiquitous across the Indian FMCG sector. It is a key ingredient in a vast array of products, including biscuits, chocolates, confectionery, dairy products like yogurts and milkshakes, and various beverages. Its consistent flavour, stability, and cost-effectiveness make it indispensable for large-scale food production. Flavouring variants, such as those combined with cocoa or chocolate, are particularly popular in the Indian market, catering to the widespread preference for these classic pairings in snacks and treats.

A common point of confusion arises between "vanilla flavouring" derived from the natural vanilla bean and its synthetic counterparts, primarily "vanillin" and "ethyl vanillin." Natural vanilla flavouring, extracted from the cured vanilla pod, contains a complex spectrum of aromatic compounds. In contrast, vanillin is the primary aromatic component of natural vanilla but is often synthesized from petrochemicals or lignin. Ethyl vanillin is a purely synthetic compound, offering a stronger vanilla-like aroma at a fraction of the cost. While natural vanilla flavouring is prized for its depth and nuance, the vast majority of "vanilla flavouring" in mass-produced Indian food products utilizes synthetic vanillin or ethyl vanillin due to their economic viability and consistent profile.
