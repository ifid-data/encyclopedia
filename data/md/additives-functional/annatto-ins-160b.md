# Annatto Ins 160B

**Annatto (INS 160b)**

Annatto, identified by the food additive code INS 160b, is a natural food colorant derived from the seeds of the *Bixa orellana* tree, native to tropical regions of the Americas. While not indigenous to India, its use as a coloring agent has become widespread in the Indian food industry. Historically, annatto has been used for centuries by indigenous communities in South and Central America as a body paint, textile dye, and a mild spice. Its introduction to India is largely through global food processing trends, where the demand for natural alternatives to synthetic colors has grown significantly. The seeds, encased in a spiky, heart-shaped pod, yield pigments known as bixin (oil-soluble) and norbixin (water-soluble), which impart hues ranging from yellow to reddish-orange.

In traditional Indian home cooking, annatto is not a staple spice or colorant in the same vein as turmeric or saffron. Its distinct, slightly earthy and peppery flavor, though mild, is not typically sought after in the diverse flavor profiles of regional Indian cuisines. However, in certain communities, particularly those with historical ties to Portuguese or other colonial influences, it might occasionally be found in marinades or rice preparations, primarily for its visual appeal rather than its flavor contribution. Its role in the Indian culinary landscape is predominantly industrial rather than domestic.

Annatto's primary application in India is as a versatile and natural food colorant within the processed food industry. Its extracts, available in both oil-soluble (bixin) and water-soluble (norbixin) forms, are extensively utilized to impart a range of yellow to orange shades. It is a common ingredient in dairy products such as cheese, butter, and margarine, where it enhances the perception of richness. Furthermore, it is widely employed in snacks like namkeen, chips, and extruded products, as well as in baked goods, confectionery, and some beverages, providing a visually appealing and stable color. Its natural origin makes it a preferred choice for manufacturers aiming to meet consumer demand for "clean label" ingredients.

Consumers often encounter annatto as an ingredient listed by its INS code (160b) or as "Annatto Extract Color" on product labels. It is crucial to understand that annatto is a natural pigment derived from a plant, distinguishing it from synthetic food colors. While the whole annatto seed or paste is used in some global cuisines for both color and a subtle flavor, in the Indian industrial context, it is almost exclusively used for its coloring properties. Its mild flavor is generally not a primary consideration, and its function is purely aesthetic, providing a vibrant and appealing hue to a wide array of processed foods.
