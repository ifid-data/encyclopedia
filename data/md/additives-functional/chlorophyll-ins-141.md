# Chlorophyll Ins 141

**Chlorophyll (INS 141)**

Chlorophyll, derived from the Greek words "chloros" (green) and "phyllon" (leaf), is the fundamental green pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, essential for photosynthesis. While its natural presence has always colored our food, its isolation and use as a food additive, specifically as Copper Complexes of Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins (INS 141), is a modern development. For industrial applications, it is typically extracted from edible plant materials like alfalfa, nettles, or grass, then processed to enhance its stability and color retention. In India, the appreciation for vibrant green hues in food is ancient, traditionally achieved through fresh herbs and vegetables.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, chlorophyll is not added as a standalone ingredient. Instead, the desired green color and associated flavors are naturally incorporated through the generous use of fresh, leafy ingredients. Spinach (palak), mint (pudina), coriander (dhaniya), fenugreek (methi), and even pandan leaves (used in some South Indian and Southeast Asian influenced dishes) are staples. These ingredients lend their natural green to curries, chutneys, parathas, and desserts, where the color is intrinsically linked to the freshness and nutritional value of the dish.

Industrially, INS 141, or Copper Chlorophyllin, is a widely utilized green food colorant. Unlike natural chlorophyll, which is highly unstable and prone to degradation (turning olive-brown in acidic conditions or with heat), INS 141 is a copper-complexed derivative that offers superior stability to light, heat, and pH changes. This makes it ideal for a vast array of processed foods in India, including confectionery, beverages, dairy products (like flavored yogurts or ice creams), sauces, desserts, and even some snack foods, where a consistent and vibrant green hue is desired for visual appeal and brand consistency.

A common point of confusion arises between "natural chlorophyll" and "Chlorophyll (INS 141)." While both are green pigments, natural chlorophyll refers to the unstable pigment present in fresh plants, which readily degrades during cooking or processing. INS 141, on the other hand, is a food additive where the magnesium atom in the chlorophyll molecule is replaced by copper, creating a much more stable, water-soluble, and vibrant green colorant suitable for industrial food applications. It is also distinct from synthetic green food colors, offering a "natural-derived" alternative, though it is chemically modified from its original plant form.
