### Corn Starch

Corn starch, often colloquially known as cornflour in India, is a fundamental functional ingredient derived from the endosperm of the maize (corn) kernel. While maize itself is native to the Americas, introduced to India by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, the industrial extraction and widespread use of corn starch gained prominence much later. Its linguistic roots trace back to the English "corn" and the Taino-derived "maize," reflecting its New World origins. Today, India is a significant producer and consumer of maize, with states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Rajasthan being major growing regions, supporting both direct consumption and industrial processing into products like corn starch.

In Indian home kitchens, corn starch is an indispensable thickening agent, particularly in Indo-Chinese cuisine for gravies, soups, and sauces, imparting a characteristic glossy sheen and smooth texture. It also serves as a binding agent in various preparations, from vegetarian cutlets and koftas to non-vegetarian kebabs, helping them hold their shape during cooking. Furthermore, its ability to create a crisp coating makes it a popular choice for batters used in deep-fried snacks like pakoras, Manchurian, and crispy fried vegetables, contributing to a desirable crunch. It's also found in traditional Indian desserts, providing body to puddings and custards.

Industrially, corn starch is a versatile ingredient across the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Its primary role as a thickener extends to a wide array of processed foods, including ready-to-eat soups, gravies, baby foods, and dairy products like yogurts and ice creams, where it contributes to desired viscosity and mouthfeel. As a binder, it's crucial in processed meats, snack foods, and confectionery. The "flour" form (cornflour) is particularly valued for its ability to create tender baked goods and as a dusting agent. Beyond food, modified corn starches find applications in pharmaceuticals as binders and disintegrants, and in various non-food industries.

A common point of confusion in India arises from the term "cornflour." While in some Western countries "cornflour" might refer to finely milled cornmeal, in India, it unequivocally denotes corn starch – a pure carbohydrate powder extracted from maize. This distinction is crucial, as cornmeal has different culinary properties. Furthermore, corn starch is often confused with refined wheat flour (maida) due to their similar appearance as white powders. However, corn starch is a pure starch, offering superior thickening power and a translucent finish, whereas maida contains gluten and proteins, resulting in a different texture and opacity when used as a thickener. It is also distinct from other starches like potato starch, which may have slightly different gelatinization properties.
