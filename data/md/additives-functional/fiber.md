### Fiber

Fiber, a broad category of indigestible carbohydrates derived from plant sources, has been an intrinsic component of the traditional Indian diet for millennia. Historically, its presence was understood through the consumption of whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, which formed the bedrock of regional cuisines. While not explicitly named "fiber" in ancient texts, the benefits of these foods for digestion and satiety were well-recognized. Modern understanding categorizes fiber into soluble (found in oats, barley, fruits, and some dals) and insoluble (found in whole grains, nuts, and vegetable skins), both crucial for gut health.

In Indian home kitchens, fiber is primarily consumed naturally through a diverse array of ingredients. Whole wheat flour (atta) for rotis and chapatis, a variety of dals (lentils) like toor, moong, and masoor, and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and fruits ensure a high fiber intake. Dishes like *dal makhani*, *rajma chawal*, and various *sabzis* (vegetable preparations) are inherently rich in fiber, contributing to digestive wellness and sustained energy, reflecting a traditional dietary wisdom that predates modern nutritional science.

In contemporary food manufacturing, fiber is increasingly incorporated as a functional ingredient. Soluble fibers like inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), often derived from chicory root, are utilized as prebiotics to support gut microbiota in products ranging from dairy alternatives to health drinks. Polydextrose, a synthetic glucose polymer, serves as a bulking agent, texturizer, and low-calorie sugar substitute in confectionery, baked goods, and beverages, enhancing mouthfeel while contributing to dietary fiber content. These added fibers address consumer demand for healthier, fiber-enriched processed foods.

A common point of confusion arises from the broad term "fiber" itself. Consumers often conflate the naturally occurring dietary fiber in whole foods with the isolated or synthetic functional fibers added to processed products. While both contribute to overall fiber intake, their sources and specific physiological effects can differ. For instance, inulin and FOS are known for their prebiotic benefits, whereas polydextrose primarily functions as a bulking agent and a source of soluble fiber. It is also important to distinguish between soluble and insoluble fibers, as they play different, yet complementary, roles in digestive health.
