**Kewra Flavouring**

Kewra flavouring is derived from the fragrant flowers of the Kewra plant (*Pandanus odoratissimus*), a tropical shrub native to South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia. In India, it is predominantly cultivated in coastal regions, particularly the Ganjam district of Odisha, and parts of Andhra Pradesh, where its flowers are harvested for their highly prized aroma. The name "Kewra" itself is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word "Ketaki," highlighting its ancient roots in Indian culture and traditional practices. Historically, the essence of Kewra has been extracted through hydro-distillation, a meticulous process that captures the delicate, sweet, and slightly musky notes of the flower.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Kewra, typically in the form of Kewra water or essence, is a cherished ingredient used sparingly to impart a distinctive floral aroma to a variety of dishes. It is a staple in Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines, where a few drops can elevate the flavour profile of rich biryanis, fragrant pulaos, and creamy kormas. Beyond savoury applications, Kewra is also a popular addition to Indian sweets and desserts such as rasgulla, gulab jamun, phirni, and karchhi, lending them an exotic and refreshing fragrance that is both unique and comforting.

In modern industrial applications, Kewra flavouring (E-FLAVOURING) finds extensive use across the FMCG sector. Its consistent aromatic profile makes it ideal for mass-produced confectionery, including candies, chocolates, and baked goods. It is also a key ingredient in various beverages, from traditional sherbets and lassi to modern soft drinks and mocktails, providing a unique floral note. Furthermore, Kewra flavouring is incorporated into ice creams, yogurts, and other dairy-based desserts, offering a sophisticated and exotic twist. Its stability and ease of integration make it a preferred choice for manufacturers seeking to replicate the authentic Kewra experience consistently.

Consumers often encounter various forms of Kewra, leading to some confusion. "Kewra Flavouring" is a broad term encompassing natural, nature-identical, or artificial compounds designed to mimic the flower's aroma, often formulated for specific industrial applications and stability. This is distinct from "Kewra Water," which is a less concentrated hydro-distillate of the flower, commonly used in home cooking. "Kewra Essence," on the other hand, is typically a more concentrated extract, often an alcoholic solution, and is used in smaller quantities. All these processed forms are, of course, distinct from the fresh Kewra flower itself, which is rarely used directly in cooking due to its potency and limited availability.
