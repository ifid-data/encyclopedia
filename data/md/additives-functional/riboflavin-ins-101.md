**Riboflavin (INS 101)**

Riboflavin, also known as Vitamin B2, is a vital water-soluble vitamin and a naturally occurring yellow-orange pigment. Its name, derived from the Latin "flavus" meaning yellow, aptly describes its characteristic hue. Discovered in the early 20th century, Riboflavin is ubiquitous in nature, found abundantly in milk, eggs, meat, leafy green vegetables, and certain fortified grains. In India, where nutritional deficiencies remain a public health concern, the natural presence of Riboflavin in traditional dairy products like curd (dahi) and paneer, as well as various greens, contributes significantly to dietary intake. Its historical recognition as an essential nutrient underscores its importance in metabolic processes.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, Riboflavin is not an ingredient added independently but is intrinsically present in many staple foods. Its contribution is primarily nutritional, supporting energy metabolism and cellular function within the body. Foods rich in Riboflavin, such as milk, eggs, and green leafy vegetables like spinach and fenugreek (methi), are integral to Indian culinary practices. While not directly used for its coloring properties in home cooking, its natural presence contributes to the subtle yellow tones of dishes containing these ingredients, such as a turmeric-infused dal or a creamy kheer.

Industrially, Riboflavin serves a dual purpose. As a food additive, it is designated INS 101 and is widely employed as a natural yellow food colorant in a range of processed foods, including beverages, dairy products, confectionery, and snacks, providing a vibrant, appealing hue. Beyond its coloring function, Riboflavin is a crucial fortificant. It is added to flours, cereals, and other processed foods as Vitamin B2 to enhance their nutritional value, addressing widespread deficiencies in the Indian population. Riboflavin 5'-phosphate sodium, a more soluble derivative, is often preferred in liquid formulations for its enhanced bioavailability and stability.

Consumers often encounter Riboflavin without fully understanding its dual identity. The most common confusion arises from its role as both a vital nutrient (Vitamin B2) and a food colorant (INS 101). While it imparts a distinct yellow color, its primary biological function is as a coenzyme in numerous metabolic reactions, essential for energy production and cellular growth. It is crucial to distinguish Riboflavin from synthetic yellow dyes, as Riboflavin offers nutritional benefits in addition to its coloring properties, making it a preferred choice for food manufacturers aiming for both visual appeal and health enhancement.
