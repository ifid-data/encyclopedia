# Ginseng

Ginseng, primarily derived from the roots of plants in the *Panax* genus, holds a revered place in East Asian traditional medicine, particularly in Korea and China, where its use dates back millennia. The name "Ginseng" itself is believed to originate from the Chinese "rénshēn," meaning "man root," a reference to the root's often human-like shape. While not indigenous to India, its global reputation as a potent adaptogen has led to its introduction and growing recognition within the Indian wellness and nutraceutical sectors, primarily through imported products and extracts.

In traditional Indian culinary practices, Ginseng has virtually no historical presence as a food ingredient or spice. Unlike indigenous herbs and spices that form the backbone of Indian cuisine, Ginseng's flavour profile and perceived medicinal properties did not integrate into the diverse regional cooking traditions. Globally, however, certain *Panax* species, especially Korean Ginseng, are occasionally incorporated into broths, teas, and tonic soups, such as the Korean *samgyetang*, where the whole root is simmered to impart its characteristic earthy flavour and health benefits.

Modern industrial applications of Ginseng in India are almost exclusively within the health and wellness industry. It is widely processed into various forms, including root extracts and powders, which are then incorporated into dietary supplements, energy drinks, functional foods, and herbal formulations. The "panax ginseng root extract" and "red ginseng extract powder" are common forms found in these products, valued for their purported adaptogenic, immune-modulating, and energy-boosting properties. These extracts allow for standardized dosing and easier integration into diverse product matrices.

A common point of confusion arises from the various forms and types of Ginseng. Consumers often conflate the whole, unprocessed *Panax* root with its highly concentrated extracts, or confuse different *Panax* species. True Ginseng refers specifically to species within the *Panax* genus, such as *Panax ginseng* (Korean/Asian Ginseng) and *Panax quinquefolius* (American Ginseng). These are distinct from "Siberian Ginseng" (*Eleutherococcus senticosus*), which, despite its name, is not a true *Panax* species and possesses different phytochemical profiles. Furthermore, "Red Ginseng" is a processed form of *Panax ginseng* where the root is steamed and dried, resulting in a reddish hue and altered chemical composition compared to "White Ginseng," which is simply dried.
