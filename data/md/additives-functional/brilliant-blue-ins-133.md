Brilliant Blue FCF, designated as INS 133 in India, is a synthetic triarylmethane dye widely used as a food colourant. Globally known as FD&C Blue No. 1 or Food Blue 2, it was first synthesized in the early 20th century and quickly gained prominence due to its vibrant and stable blue hue. In India, its usage is strictly regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), ensuring its application within permissible limits in various food products. As a synthetic compound, it has no natural origin or traditional sourcing methods, being produced through chemical synthesis.

In the context of Indian home kitchens, Brilliant Blue FCF is not a traditional ingredient. Indian culinary heritage primarily relies on natural colourants derived from spices, fruits, and vegetables like turmeric, saffron, beetroot, or spinach for aesthetic appeal. However, its presence is ubiquitous in many packaged food items commonly consumed in Indian households, such as certain confectionery, ice creams, and beverages, where it contributes to the visual attractiveness of modern processed foods.

Industrially, Brilliant Blue FCF is a cornerstone in the FMCG sector, valued for its intense colour, excellent stability to heat and light, and cost-effectiveness. It is extensively used in a diverse range of products including carbonated drinks, candies, jellies, dairy desserts, baked goods, and processed snacks. The dye is available in two primary forms: a water-soluble dye, ideal for clear beverages, syrups, and gelatin-based products, and an insoluble "lake" form. The lake form, created by adsorbing the dye onto an inert substrate like alumina, is preferred for fat-based products, coatings, and dry mixes where colour migration is undesirable, ensuring the colour stays localized within the product matrix.

Consumers often encounter Brilliant Blue FCF without understanding its different forms. The primary distinction lies between the water-soluble dye and its insoluble "lake" variant. While the dye provides a brilliant blue in aqueous solutions, the lake form is crucial for applications requiring a non-bleeding colour, such as in confectionery coatings or fat-based fillings. It is also important to distinguish Brilliant Blue FCF from natural blue colourants, such as those derived from spirulina or butterfly pea flower, which are gaining traction but offer different hues and stability profiles compared to the consistent, vivid blue of INS 133.
