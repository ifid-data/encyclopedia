# Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12, scientifically known as cobalamin, is a vital water-soluble vitamin indispensable for numerous bodily functions, including neurological health, DNA synthesis, and the formation of red blood cells. Its discovery in the mid-20th century was a landmark event, particularly in understanding and treating pernicious anemia. Uniquely among vitamins, B12 is not synthesized by plants or animals directly but by specific microorganisms (bacteria and archaea). Animals acquire it through their diet or by consuming these microbes. For humans, the primary dietary sources are animal products such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy. In India, where vegetarianism is widely practiced, B12 deficiency is a significant public health concern, often necessitating dietary adjustments, fortification, or supplementation.

In traditional Indian home cooking, Vitamin B12 is not an ingredient added directly but is naturally present in certain dietary components. Dairy products like milk, paneer, and curd, along with eggs, serve as common sources for lacto-vegetarians and ovo-vegetarians. Non-vegetarian diets, encompassing chicken, fish, and mutton, typically provide ample B12. However, for strict vegetarians and vegans, traditional home cooking often lacks direct B12 sources, making it a nutrient of critical concern. Its presence in the diet is thus more a function of ingredient choice rather than a specific culinary application or preparation method.

Industrially, Vitamin B12 is a crucial fortifying agent and a key ingredient in a vast array of nutritional supplements. It is extensively added to plant-based milk alternatives (such as soy, almond, and oat milk), breakfast cereals, nutritional yeasts, and meat substitutes to address potential dietary gaps, especially for vegan and vegetarian populations. In the pharmaceutical sector, B12 is formulated into tablets, capsules, and injections for the treatment and prevention of deficiencies. Its inherent stability and water-solubility make it an ideal candidate for incorporation into a wide range of processed foods and beverages, thereby ensuring broader public access to this essential micronutrient.

A pervasive misconception surrounding Vitamin B12 pertains to its natural dietary sources. Unlike other B vitamins, which are readily available in various plant foods, B12 is almost exclusively found in animal products or derived from microbial synthesis. Many consumers mistakenly believe that certain plant-based foods like spirulina, tempeh, or fermented products are reliable sources; however, these often contain inactive B12 analogues or insufficient quantities. It is imperative to understand that for individuals adhering to strict vegetarian or vegan diets, consistent intake of B12 from fortified foods or reliable supplements is essential to prevent deficiency, as direct and bioavailable plant-based sources are generally unreliable.
