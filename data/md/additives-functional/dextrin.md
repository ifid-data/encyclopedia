**Dextrin**

Dextrin refers to a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch. Discovered in the early 19th century by French chemist Henri Braconnot, dextrins are typically white, yellow, or brown powders that are partially or fully soluble in water, forming a viscous solution. In India, dextrins are primarily sourced from common starches such as corn, potato, tapioca, and significantly, wheat, reflecting the country's diverse agricultural base. The production process involves heating starch, often with an acid catalyst, to break down its complex polysaccharide chains into smaller units, making it a versatile derivative widely used across various industries.

While pure dextrin is not a direct ingredient in traditional Indian home cooking, its functional properties are indirectly experienced in many dishes. For instance, the browning and crisping of foods like *pakoras* or *bhajiyas* during frying involve the formation of dextrins from the starch present in the batter. Similarly, the thickening of gravies and sauces, often achieved by roasting flours before adding liquids, can lead to the partial dextrinization of the starch, contributing to a smoother texture and enhanced flavour profile.

In the industrial food sector, dextrins are indispensable. They serve as effective thickeners, binders, emulsifiers, and texturizers in a vast array of FMCG products. Wheat dextrin, for example, is frequently incorporated into dietary fibre supplements, prebiotics, and as a bulking agent in low-calorie foods due to its high soluble fibre content. Other forms, such as oxidized dextrins (sometimes referred to as "odextrin"), are valued for their film-forming capabilities, making them suitable for coatings, glazes, and as stabilizers in confectionery and baked goods, improving texture and extending shelf life.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding dextrin's identity, frequently conflating it with native starch or more extensively hydrolyzed products like maltodextrin. Dextrin is distinct from raw starch as it has undergone partial hydrolysis, resulting in lower viscosity and improved solubility. It also differs from maltodextrin, which is a more extensively hydrolyzed starch product with a higher Dextrose Equivalent (DE) and typically lower molecular weight. Variants like "wheat dextrin" simply denote the starch source, indicating dextrin derived specifically from wheat, which may offer unique textural or nutritional benefits, such as a higher soluble fibre content, compared to dextrins from other botanical sources.
