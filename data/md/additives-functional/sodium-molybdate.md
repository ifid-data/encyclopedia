**Sodium Molybdate**

Sodium molybdate is the sodium salt of molybdic acid, primarily valued as a stable and bioavailable source of the essential trace mineral molybdenum. While not a traditional ingredient with a culinary heritage in India, its significance lies in its role as a micronutrient. Molybdenum is crucial for the function of several enzymes in the human body, including sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase, which are involved in metabolism and detoxification processes. Its presence in the Indian diet is typically through naturally occurring sources like legumes, grains, and leafy green vegetables, rather than direct historical culinary application of the salt itself.

In home kitchens, sodium molybdate is not used as a direct cooking ingredient. Its presence in food consumed at home would be indirect, primarily through fortified food products or dietary supplements. Traditional Indian cooking relies on a diverse array of whole foods, which naturally provide a spectrum of micronutrients. Therefore, the concept of adding a specific molybdenum salt to daily preparations is alien to conventional Indian culinary practices, where nutritional balance is achieved through varied and balanced meals.

Industrially, sodium molybdate finds its primary application as a fortifying agent in the food and nutraceutical sectors. It is commonly incorporated into infant formulas, nutritional supplements, and certain fortified food products to ensure adequate intake of molybdenum, especially in populations or individuals with specific dietary needs. Its high solubility and stability make it an ideal choice for these applications, ensuring consistent delivery of the trace mineral. Beyond human nutrition, it is also used in animal feed to prevent molybdenum deficiencies in livestock.

Consumers often encounter "molybdenum" listed in nutritional panels, but may not distinguish between the elemental mineral and its various salt forms. Sodium molybdate is specifically a chemical compound used to *deliver* molybdenum, rather than being the mineral itself. It is distinct from other sodium salts like sodium chloride (common salt) or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), as its function is solely to provide the trace element molybdenum, not to impart flavour, leavening, or preservation. Its usage is in minute, carefully controlled quantities due to its trace mineral status.
