# Sodium Aluminium Sulphate Ins 521

**Sodium Aluminium Sulphate (INS 521)**

Sodium Aluminium Sulphate (SAS), identified by the international code INS 521, is a synthetic inorganic salt primarily utilized as a food additive. While it lacks a traditional "heritage" in the culinary sense, its introduction to India, like many modern food additives, came with the industrialization of food processing. It is a product of chemical synthesis, typically derived from aluminium hydroxide, sulphuric acid, and sodium hydroxide. Unlike agricultural products, its "sourcing" is industrial, with manufacturers globally producing it for various applications, including food.

In the Indian home kitchen, Sodium Aluminium Sulphate is not typically used as a standalone ingredient. Its primary function is as a leavening acid, almost exclusively found as a component within commercially prepared double-acting baking powders. These baking powders are used in homes for baking cakes, cookies, and other leavened goods, providing a controlled rise. Its slow-acting nature means it reacts gradually with sodium bicarbonate, releasing carbon dioxide both when mixed with liquid and again when heated, ensuring a consistent rise during the baking process.

Industrially, INS 521 is a crucial ingredient in the formulation of many packaged baked goods across India's FMCG sector. Its slow-release leavening action is highly valued in commercial bakeries for products like biscuits, cakes, muffins, and certain types of breads, as it allows for greater processing time without premature gas release. Beyond leavening, it also functions as an acidity regulator and a firming agent in some processed foods, contributing to texture and stability. Its cost-effectiveness and reliable performance make it a preferred choice for large-scale food production.

Consumers often encounter Sodium Aluminium Sulphate without realizing its specific role, as it is an ingredient *within* baking powder rather than a direct purchase. It is important to distinguish SAS from other leavening acids like cream of tartar or monocalcium phosphate, which have different reaction rates and applications. Furthermore, while concerns about aluminium in food occasionally arise, the levels of SAS used in food products are regulated, and it is distinct from the aluminium found in cooking utensils or other forms. It is also not to be confused with alum (potassium aluminium sulphate), which has different culinary and non-culinary uses.
