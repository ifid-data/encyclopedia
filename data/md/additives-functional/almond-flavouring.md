### Almond Flavouring

Almond flavouring, known colloquially as *badam flavouring* in India, is a concentrated aromatic preparation designed to impart the characteristic taste and aroma of almonds. While almonds themselves (Prunus dulcis) originated in the Middle East and were introduced to India centuries ago, becoming integral to Mughlai cuisine and traditional sweets, the flavouring is a modern innovation. It is typically derived either from natural extracts, often from bitter almonds (which contain amygdalin, yielding benzaldehyde upon hydrolysis), or through synthetic production of benzaldehyde, the primary compound responsible for almond's distinctive aroma. Its widespread use reflects the global popularity of almond-based confections and the need for a consistent, cost-effective flavour profile.

In Indian home kitchens, almond flavouring is a versatile ingredient, particularly in the preparation of traditional sweets (*mithai*), desserts like *kheer*, *falooda*, and milkshakes. It allows home cooks to infuse the rich, nutty essence of almonds into dishes without the need for expensive whole almonds, or to enhance the flavour of dishes already containing almonds. It is also commonly used in baking, from cakes and cookies to puddings, where it provides a consistent and potent almond note.

Industrially, almond flavouring is a staple in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. It is extensively used in confectionery, including chocolates, candies, and marzipan-like products, as well as in biscuits, ice creams, and a wide array of beverages. The "roasted almonds flavouring" variant offers a deeper, more complex profile, often preferred in premium ice creams, energy bars, and specific bakery items to mimic the taste of toasted nuts. Its functional benefits include providing a stable flavour, reducing ingredient costs, and offering an allergen-controlled alternative to actual almonds in certain formulations.

A common point of confusion arises between "almond flavouring" and actual "almonds." While both contribute to the almond taste, the flavouring is a concentrated extract or synthetic compound primarily for aroma and taste, offering no nutritional value or textural contribution. Actual almonds, on the other hand, provide fibre, protein, and healthy fats, along with their distinct crunch. Furthermore, almond flavouring can be derived from natural sources (like bitter almonds) or be entirely artificial (synthesized benzaldehyde), a distinction often relevant for dietary preferences. The term *badam flavouring* is simply the Hindi equivalent, referring to the same product.
