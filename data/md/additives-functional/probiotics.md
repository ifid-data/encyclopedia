# Probiotics

The scientific understanding of beneficial microorganisms, later termed "probiotics," emerged in the early 20th century. However, India's culinary heritage has long embraced fermented foods, implicitly leveraging the health benefits of live cultures. Traditional staples like dahi (curd), chaas (buttermilk), kanji (fermented drinks), and batters for idli and dosa are ancient examples of foods rich in diverse microbial populations. Modern probiotics, however, involve specific, well-characterized microbial strains, primarily bacteria and yeasts, cultured under controlled conditions. These strains are selected for their proven health benefits and stability, often sourced globally and then propagated for commercial use.

In Indian home kitchens, probiotics are not typically added as isolated ingredients but are integral to the consumption of traditional fermented foods. Dahi is a cornerstone of the Indian diet, consumed plain, as raita, or blended into lassi and chaas, providing a natural source of lactic acid bacteria. Similarly, the fermentation process for idli and dosa batters introduces beneficial microbes, contributing to their unique texture, flavour, and digestibility. These traditional methods represent a centuries-old, intuitive understanding of gut health and microbial benefits, predating modern scientific nomenclature.

The industrial application of probiotics in India has seen significant growth, particularly in the functional food and nutraceutical sectors. Specific strains like *Bacillus coagulans* (e.g., SNZ 1969, MTCC 5856), *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum*, *Bacillus clausii*, and *Bacillus subtilis* are incorporated into a wide array of FMCG products. These include fortified dairy products like yogurts, lassi, and cheese, as well as health drinks, nutritional supplements, and some snack foods. Proprietary "probiotic blends," such as the "Proabsorb blend," are formulated to deliver a synergistic range of benefits, often targeting digestive health, immunity, and nutrient absorption. Some advanced formulations may even combine probiotics with digestive enzymes, as seen in "Pepryme Pro Protease Enzyme" blends, for comprehensive gut support.

A common point of confusion arises between "probiotics" and "prebiotics." Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible food ingredients (often fibers) that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial bacteria in the colon. While traditional Indian fermented foods contain beneficial microbes, commercially available probiotic products typically feature specific, scientifically validated strains with documented health effects, unlike the variable microbial composition of homemade ferments. Furthermore, consumers should note that while some probiotic blends may include enzymes for digestive support, the enzymes themselves are not probiotics.
