# Goat Meat

Goat meat, known as 'chevon' internationally, is a foundational protein source deeply embedded in India's culinary and cultural landscape. Goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) were among the earliest domesticated animals, with their origins tracing back to the Fertile Crescent. In India, goat rearing has been practiced for millennia, making it an integral part of rural livelihoods and food systems across the subcontinent. Linguistically, it is referred to as "bakri ka gosht" in Hindi, "aadu irachi" in Tamil, and "chhagol mangsho" in Bengali. While goats are raised nationwide, states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Maharashtra are significant producers, contributing substantially to both meat and dairy supply chains.

In Indian home kitchens, goat meat is a cherished ingredient, celebrated for its robust flavour and versatility. It forms the heart of numerous traditional dishes, from the rich, slow-cooked curries like Rogan Josh and Kosha Mangsho to aromatic Biryanis (e.g., Hyderabadi, Lucknowi) and succulent Kebabs (Seekh, Galouti). Its lean yet flavourful profile makes it ideal for long, slow cooking methods such as braising and stewing, which tenderize the meat and allow it to absorb complex spice blends. Paya (trotter soup) and Haleem are other popular preparations, showcasing the meat's ability to yield deeply satisfying and nutritious meals.

While fresh goat meat remains the primary form of consumption, its presence in the industrial and modern food sector is steadily growing. FMCG companies are increasingly offering processed goat meat products, including ready-to-eat curries, frozen marinated cuts, and kebabs, catering to convenience-seeking consumers. Specialty restaurants and ethnic food markets also drive demand for specific cuts and preparations. The lean nature of goat meat aligns with contemporary health trends, positioning it as a desirable red meat alternative, though it is not typically subjected to industrial fractionation like certain fats or proteins.

A common source of confusion in India arises from the interchangeable use of "mutton" for both goat and sheep meat. Technically, 'goat meat' (chevon) comes from adult goats, characterized by its leaner texture, lower fat content, and a distinct, often more pronounced gamey flavour. 'Lamb' refers to meat from young sheep (under one year old), which is typically more tender and milder in flavour with a higher fat content. 'Mutton' specifically denotes meat from adult sheep (over one year old), which is fattier and has a stronger flavour than lamb but is generally less gamey than goat. In many parts of India, particularly the North, the term "mutton" colloquially refers to goat meat, while in the South, the distinction is often clearer. This linguistic overlap can lead to misidentification, impacting culinary expectations regarding flavour and cooking times.
