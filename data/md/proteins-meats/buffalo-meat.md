### Buffalo Meat

India boasts the world's largest buffalo population, primarily the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), which has been integral to the subcontinent's agrarian economy for millennia. Historically, buffaloes have been domesticated for their milk, draught power in agriculture, and as a significant source of meat. The consumption of buffalo meat, often referred to as 'carabeef' in trade, is deeply embedded in the culinary traditions of various communities across India, though its acceptance and availability vary regionally due to diverse cultural and religious sentiments. Major sourcing regions for buffalo meat include states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, where buffalo rearing is widespread.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, buffalo meat is valued for its robust flavour and lean profile. It is commonly prepared in slow-cooked dishes such as rich curries, hearty stews, and flavourful biryanis, particularly in regions like Kerala, Goa, and parts of North-East India where its consumption is more prevalent. Due to its inherent leanness and slightly tougher texture compared to some other red meats, buffalo meat often benefits from extensive marination with tenderising agents like raw papaya or yoghurt, and prolonged cooking methods to achieve optimal tenderness and absorb spices fully. It forms the base for various regional delicacies.

Beyond traditional home cooking, buffalo meat holds significant importance in India's industrial food sector and as a major export commodity. India is a leading global exporter of processed and frozen buffalo meat, contributing substantially to the country's agricultural exports. Industrially, it is processed into various forms, including boneless cuts, mince, and value-added products like sausages, cold cuts, and ready-to-eat meals for both domestic and international markets. Its lean composition makes it a preferred choice for manufacturers aiming for lower fat content in their products, catering to health-conscious consumers and the food service industry.

A common point of confusion, particularly in the Indian context, is the distinction between buffalo meat and beef (cow meat). While both are red meats, they differ significantly in cultural, legal, and culinary aspects. Buffalo meat, or carabeef, is generally leaner, darker, and possesses a coarser grain and a distinct, slightly gamey flavour compared to beef. Legally, the sale and consumption of buffalo meat are permitted in most Indian states, unlike beef, which faces bans or severe restrictions in many regions due to religious sensitivities. Nutritionally, buffalo meat is often lauded for its lower fat and cholesterol content, making it a distinct and often preferred alternative where available.
