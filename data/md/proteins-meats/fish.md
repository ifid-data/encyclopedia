Fish

Fish and its derivatives represent a vital intersection of traditional Indian coastal nutrition and modern functional food science. India’s vast 7,500 km coastline, spanning from the Konkan to the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, has fostered a deep-rooted heritage of fish consumption. Varieties like Mackerel (*Bangda*), Sardines (*Tarli*), and Anchovies (*Nethili*) are staples in regional cuisines, particularly in Kerala, Goa, and West Bengal. Historically, these small pelagic fish were prized not only for their abundance but for their role as a primary protein source for coastal communities. While salmon and cod are largely imported or sourced from colder waters, they have gained significant traction in the Indian urban market due to their perceived premium nutritional status.

In traditional Indian households, fish is celebrated for its regional diversity. Mackerel is often stuffed with spicy *recheado* paste in Goa, while Sardines are a mainstay of the spicy, tamarind-based fish curries of the Malabar coast. Anchovies, often consumed fresh or sun-dried, are frequently used in crispy deep-fried preparations or ground into coarse chutneys in South India. Beyond their culinary appeal, these oily fish are culturally recognized as "brain food," a traditional wisdom that aligns with their high concentration of essential fatty acids. The preparation methods—ranging from mustard-oil based gravies in the East to coconut-milk stews in the South—highlight the ingredient's versatility across the subcontinent’s micro-climates.

The industrial application of fish has shifted significantly toward the "Additives & Functional" space, specifically through the extraction of fish oils. Modern FMCG and nutraceutical sectors in India utilize fish oil (M-OIL) derived from Anchovies, Sardines, and Salmon as a primary source of Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA. These oils are encapsulated into health supplements or used to fortify "smart foods" like specialized milk powders and margarines. Cod Liver Oil (P-VAR_COD_LIVER) remains a distinct industrial category, historically used in India as a therapeutic supplement for Vitamin A and D. In food technology, these oils undergo rigorous refining to remove "fishy" odors, allowing them to be integrated into functional foods without altering the sensory profile.

A critical distinction must be made between "Fish Oil" and "Cod Liver Oil." While both are marine-derived, Fish Oil is extracted from the flesh of oily fish (like Sardines and Mackerel) and is primarily valued for Omega-3 fatty acids. In contrast, Cod Liver Oil is extracted specifically from the liver of cod fish and contains high levels of fat-soluble Vitamins A and D in addition to Omega-3s. Furthermore, consumers often confuse "Anchovies" with small "Sardines"; however, Anchovies are smaller, more slender, and possess a much stronger, saltier umami profile when cured, whereas Sardines are oilier and have a milder, "meatier" texture.
