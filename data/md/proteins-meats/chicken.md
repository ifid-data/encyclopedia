**Chicken**

Chicken, derived from the domesticated fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), originated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia, with its presence in the Indian subcontinent dating back millennia. Archaeological findings confirm its ancient and integral role in India's culinary and cultural landscape. Known as 'Murga' (Hindi), 'Kozhi' (Tamil), and 'Kodi' (Telugu), chicken farming is a vital agricultural sector. Major commercial poultry operations thrive across states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Punjab, contributing significantly to rural economies and national food supply.

In Indian home kitchens, chicken is celebrated for its versatility and ability to absorb diverse flavours. It forms the basis for iconic dishes like Butter Chicken, Chettinad Chicken, aromatic Biryanis, and succulent Tandoori preparations. Traditionally, it's stewed, curried, fried, grilled, or roasted. "Chicken bits" (smaller cuts) are favoured for quick stir-fries, gravies, and snacks due to their convenience. Rendered chicken fat is occasionally used in traditional cooking to impart distinct richness and flavour, particularly in regional non-vegetarian dishes.

Industrially, chicken is a cornerstone of India's processed food sector. It's extensively used in ready-to-eat meals, frozen snacks (nuggets, sausages, patties), and various canned products like "chicken meat" and "chicken bits" for convenience and shelf-life. Beyond whole meat, derivatives such as broth, stock, and protein isolates serve as crucial functional ingredients in FMCG products, enhancing flavour and nutrition in soups, sauces, and instant noodles. India's robust poultry industry growth highlights its role in providing an affordable, accessible protein source.

Consumers often encounter various forms of chicken. Fundamentally, "chicken" refers to the meat of domesticated fowl, distinct from other poultry like duck or quail. Market offerings include "chicken meat" (general cuts), "chicken bits" (smaller, boneless pieces), and "chicken fat." A significant modern distinction arises with plant-based or synthetic "chicken" alternatives. These products, often called "mock meat" or "vegan chicken," are engineered to mimic the sensory attributes of real chicken, providing non-animal protein options for a growing consumer base.
