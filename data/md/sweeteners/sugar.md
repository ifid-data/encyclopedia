**Sugar**

Sugar, primarily sucrose, holds a profound and ancient place in Indian culinary and cultural heritage. Native to tropical South and Southeast Asia, sugarcane (*Saccharum officinarum*) is believed to have been first domesticated in India, with references dating back to Vedic texts as *ikshu*. The Sanskrit term *sharkara* (meaning "gravel" or "grit") is the etymological root of the English word "sugar," highlighting India's historical significance in its production and dissemination. Major sugarcane growing regions in India include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat, which are vital for both refined sugar and traditional unrefined forms like jaggery (gur), khandsari, and mishri.

In Indian home kitchens, sugar is an indispensable sweetener, used extensively in beverages like tea and coffee, and forming the backbone of countless traditional desserts (*mithai*), such as *kheer*, *halwa*, *ladoo*, and *gulab jamun*. Beyond its sweetening role, it is also employed to balance flavours in savoury dishes, chutneys, and pickles. Traditional forms like jaggery are preferred for their distinct caramel notes and perceived health benefits in regional specialties, while *mishri* (rock sugar) is often used as a mouth freshener, a religious offering, or in Ayurvedic preparations. Powdered sugar is commonly used for dusting sweets or in delicate baked goods, and sugar syrups are fundamental for soaking fried desserts or making preserves.

Industrially, refined white sugar is a cornerstone of the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, widely used in confectionery, baked goods, carbonated beverages, and a vast array of processed foods. Sugar syrup provides a consistent and easily dispersible sweetening agent for drinks, sauces, and canned fruits. Invert sugar, a mixture of glucose and fructose derived from sucrose, is particularly valued in industrial applications for its ability to prevent crystallization, enhance moisture retention, and provide a smoother texture in products like ice creams, jams, and certain confectionery items. Concentrated sugarcane juice serves as a base for various natural sweeteners and food products.

Consumers often encounter a range of "sugars," leading to some confusion regarding their distinctions. While "sugar" most commonly refers to refined white sucrose, it encompasses a broader spectrum. Refined white sugar is highly processed, yielding pure sucrose with a neutral flavour. Brown sugar is typically refined white sugar with molasses added back, or less refined cane sugar, offering a distinct flavour and moisture. Jaggery (gur) is an unrefined, non-centrifugal cane sugar that retains all the molasses and minerals, resulting in a complex, earthy flavour and dark colour. Khandsari and Desi Khand are partially refined, crystalline sugars, less processed than white sugar. Mishri (rock sugar) is a crystallized form, often from sugarcane or palm sap, prized for its purity and traditional uses. Palm sugar and coconut sugar, derived from the sap of respective palm trees, offer unique caramel notes and are often marketed for their perceived lower glycemic index. Invert sugar, distinct from these, is a functional ingredient used for its specific technical properties rather than as a direct substitute for table sugar.
