# Sucralose Ins 955

**Sucralose (INS 955)**

Sucralose, identified by the international food additive code INS 955, is a synthetic, non-nutritive sweetener discovered in 1976 in the UK. Its name is a portmanteau of "sucrose" and the suffix "-ose" for sugar, reflecting its origin from sucrose. While not indigenous to India, sucralose was introduced and gained significant traction in the Indian market with the growing awareness of calorie reduction and the demand for sugar-free alternatives, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It is synthetically manufactured through a multi-step process that selectively replaces three hydroxyl groups of sucrose with chlorine atoms, altering its chemical structure to prevent metabolism by the body.

In Indian home kitchens, sucralose has become a popular sugar substitute for individuals managing diabetes, weight, or simply seeking to reduce sugar intake. It is commonly used to sweeten daily beverages like tea and coffee, where its high heat stability ensures its sweetness is retained even at high temperatures. Beyond beverages, it finds application in homemade desserts, puddings, and baked goods, allowing for the creation of "sugar-free" versions of traditional Indian sweets, though its distinct taste profile may require careful adjustment in recipes. Its adoption reflects a modern shift in dietary habits rather than a traditional culinary practice.

Industrially, sucralose is a cornerstone in the formulation of a vast array of FMCG products in India. Its exceptional heat stability and long shelf life make it ideal for use in baked goods, processed snacks, carbonated soft drinks, fruit juices, dairy products like yogurts, and confectionery. It is also a key ingredient in many "diet" or "sugar-free" labelled products, including health supplements and pharmaceuticals, where it provides sweetness without contributing to caloric content or affecting blood glucose levels. Its versatility allows manufacturers to meet consumer demand for healthier alternatives across diverse food categories.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding sucralose, frequently conflating it with other artificial sweeteners such as Aspartame (INS 951) or Saccharin (INS 954), or even natural low-calorie options like Stevia (INS 960). The primary distinction lies in its chemical origin and properties: sucralose is derived directly from sucrose, yet it is approximately 600 times sweeter than sugar and passes through the body largely unabsorbed, thus contributing zero calories. Unlike Aspartame, which can degrade at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its sweetness under heat, making it suitable for cooking and baking. It offers a clean, sugar-like taste profile compared to the sometimes bitter aftertaste associated with other high-intensity sweeteners.
