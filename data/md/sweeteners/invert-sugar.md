Invert sugar, a saccharide mixture of glucose and fructose, is derived from the hydrolysis of sucrose. This process, known as inversion, typically involves heating sucrose with water in the presence of an acid or an enzyme (invertase), which breaks the disaccharide sucrose into its constituent monosaccharides. The term "invert" refers to the change in the optical rotation of polarized light that occurs during this chemical transformation. While not indigenous to India, the principles of sugar chemistry and its applications have been understood and utilized in the subcontinent's vast sugar industry, which primarily processes sugarcane. Invert sugar is thus manufactured domestically from readily available sucrose.

In traditional Indian home cooking, invert sugar is not directly used as a standalone ingredient. However, the desired properties of invert sugar—such as its ability to prevent crystallization and retain moisture—are often achieved implicitly when making various sugar syrups (chashni) for sweets like gulab jamun, jalebi, or balushahi. The prolonged cooking of sugar with a touch of acid (like lemon juice or cream of tartar) in these preparations partially inverts the sucrose, contributing to the desired texture and shelf life of the final product, even if the home cook isn't explicitly creating "invert sugar."

Industrially, invert sugar, predominantly in its liquid syrup form, is a highly valued ingredient in the Indian food processing sector. Its key functional benefits include superior moisture retention, which extends the shelf life and maintains the softness of baked goods, confectionery, and energy bars. It also inhibits sugar crystallization, making it ideal for ice creams, fondants, and glazes, ensuring a smooth texture. Furthermore, invert sugar is sweeter than sucrose and contributes to enhanced browning reactions, desirable in many processed foods. It is widely employed in the manufacture of biscuits, cakes, jams, jellies, soft drinks, and various snack items.

Consumers often encounter "invert sugar syrup" without fully understanding its distinction from regular table sugar (sucrose) or other syrups. Invert sugar is a mixture of glucose and fructose, whereas sucrose is a single disaccharide molecule. This chemical difference gives invert sugar its unique properties, such as higher sweetness and a reduced tendency to crystallize. It is also distinct from "golden syrup," which is a partially inverted sugar syrup often produced with a specific flavour profile due to controlled caramelization, making it a different product in terms of composition and sensory attributes. Misspellings like "evert syrup" or "inverter sugar syrup" are common errors for the correct term, "invert syrup."
