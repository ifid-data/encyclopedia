# Thaumatin Ins 957

**Thaumatin (INS 957)**

Thaumatin (INS 957) is a naturally occurring, high-intensity protein sweetener and flavour enhancer derived from the arils of the katemfe fruit (Thaumatococcus daniellii), native to the rainforests of West Africa. The name "thaumatin" itself is rooted in the Greek word "thauma," meaning "wonder" or "miracle," reflecting its extraordinary sweetness. Unlike many traditional Indian sweeteners or spices, Thaumatin has no indigenous history or cultivation in India. Its presence in the Indian food landscape is purely as an imported, industrially applied food additive, valued for its unique properties rather than its agricultural heritage within the subcontinent.

In the context of Indian home kitchens and traditional culinary practices, Thaumatin holds no place. It is not an ingredient that would be found in a typical Indian pantry, nor is it used in any traditional recipes for tempering, frying, or flavouring. Its extreme sweetness (approximately 2000-3000 times sweeter than sucrose) and specific functional characteristics make it unsuitable for direct home use, where sugar, jaggery, or honey are the conventional sweetening agents. Its application is entirely within the realm of processed food manufacturing.

Thaumatin finds significant application in the Indian food processing industry, particularly in FMCG products. It is primarily utilized as a high-intensity sweetener and, more importantly, as a flavour enhancer. Its proteinaceous nature contributes to a unique mouthfeel and can mask undesirable off-notes, especially in products containing other high-intensity sweeteners like stevia or sucralose. It is commonly incorporated into chewing gums, beverages, dairy products, confectionery, and certain pharmaceutical formulations. Its ability to enhance mint, fruit, and chocolate flavours, alongside its "natural" origin, makes it a valuable ingredient for formulators aiming for reduced sugar content and improved taste profiles.

Consumers often confuse Thaumatin with other high-intensity sweeteners such as Stevia, Aspartame, or Sucralose, primarily due to their shared function of providing sweetness without significant caloric contribution. However, Thaumatin stands apart as a protein-based sweetener, offering a distinct sweetness profile characterized by a slower onset and a lingering aftertaste, which can be leveraged for specific product applications. Crucially, its role as a flavour enhancer, capable of modifying and boosting existing flavours, differentiates it from sweeteners that solely provide sweetness. It is also distinct from bulk sweeteners like sugar or jaggery, which provide volume and texture in addition to sweetness.
