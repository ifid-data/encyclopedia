# Butterscotch

Butterscotch, a beloved confectionery and flavour profile, traces its origins to 19th-century Britain, particularly Scotland. Traditionally, it is a hard candy or sauce made by boiling brown sugar and butter, often with cream or milk, and a touch of vanilla and salt, to a specific temperature. The use of brown sugar is key, imparting a deeper, more complex molasses-like note compared to the simpler sweetness of white sugar. While not indigenous to India, its introduction likely came through British colonial influence, gradually finding its way into the Indian palate through Western-style desserts and confectionery.

In Indian home kitchens, butterscotch is primarily encountered as a flavouring agent or as ready-made confectionery. It is a popular choice for enhancing the taste of homemade cakes, puddings, and milkshakes, often in the form of a sauce or essence. Butterscotch pieces, or "M-BITS," are frequently used as crunchy toppings for ice creams, a textural element in cookies, or as inclusions in various baked goods, adding both flavour and a delightful bite to traditional Indian-adapted desserts.

Industrially, butterscotch is a ubiquitous flavour in the Indian FMCG sector. As an "E-FLAVOURING," it is extensively used in a wide array of products, from ice creams and chocolates to biscuits, candies, and dairy beverages, providing a consistent and appealing taste profile. The "M-BITS" form, comprising small, hard pieces of butterscotch, is a popular inclusion in premium ice creams, snack bars, and confectionery, offering a distinct crunch and burst of flavour that enhances the consumer experience. The versatility of butterscotch allows it to be incorporated into both sweet and occasionally savoury applications, though its primary role remains in the dessert and snack categories.

A common point of confusion for consumers, particularly in India, is distinguishing butterscotch from caramel. While both are sugar-based confections, caramel is typically made by heating white sugar until it caramelizes, often resulting in a simpler, sometimes slightly bitter, burnt sugar flavour. Butterscotch, by contrast, traditionally relies on brown sugar and butter, yielding a richer, more buttery, and nuanced taste profile. It is also distinct from toffee, which is generally harder and chewier, though the ingredients can overlap. The unique combination of brown sugar and butter gives butterscotch its characteristic depth and warmth, setting it apart from its confectionery cousins.
