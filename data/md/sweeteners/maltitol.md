## Maltitol

Maltitol, a sugar alcohol or polyol, is a modern ingredient primarily valued for its properties as a bulk sweetener and sugar substitute. Chemically, it is a disaccharide alcohol, produced by the hydrogenation of maltose, which is typically derived from starch sources like corn or wheat. Unlike traditional sugars, maltitol is not found naturally in significant quantities but is synthesized for industrial applications. Its introduction to the Indian market is relatively recent, driven by the growing demand for low-calorie and sugar-free food options, particularly among health-conscious consumers and those managing diabetes.

In traditional Indian home cooking, maltitol holds no historical or cultural significance, as it is a product of modern food technology. Indian culinary practices have historically relied on natural sweeteners like jaggery, honey, and various forms of sugar. Therefore, maltitol is not a staple in the average Indian kitchen for daily cooking. However, individuals at home who are specifically looking to reduce sugar intake or manage blood glucose levels might use maltitol-based products or incorporate it into recipes as a direct sugar replacement, though its availability for direct home use is less common than in packaged goods.

Maltitol (INS 965(i)) finds extensive application in the Indian food processing industry, particularly in the "sugar-free" and "no added sugar" segments. Its functional properties make it ideal for a range of FMCG products: it provides bulk and texture similar to sugar, has good heat stability for baking, and is non-cariogenic (does not promote tooth decay). It is widely used in sugar-free chocolates, candies, chewing gums, baked goods, ice creams, and dietetic products. Its ability to mimic sugar's mouthfeel and texture, combined with its lower caloric value and reduced impact on blood sugar, makes it a preferred choice for manufacturers targeting health-conscious consumers.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding maltitol's role and properties compared to other sweeteners. It is crucial to distinguish maltitol from regular sugar (sucrose); while both provide sweetness and bulk, maltitol offers fewer calories and a lower glycemic index. It also differs from high-intensity artificial sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame, which are much sweeter than sugar and provide no bulk. Maltitol, being a bulk sweetener, contributes to the texture and volume of products, making it a more direct replacement for sugar in terms of physical properties, albeit with a slightly lower sweetness intensity. Furthermore, like other polyols, excessive consumption of maltitol can lead to a laxative effect, a characteristic not shared by high-intensity sweeteners or regular sugar.
