Isomalt is a sugar alcohol (polyol) derived from sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. Developed in the 1960s, it is produced through a two-stage enzymatic process where sucrose is first converted into isomaltulose, which is then hydrogenated to yield isomalt. Unlike many traditional Indian ingredients, Isomalt has no historical or linguistic roots in the subcontinent, being a modern food additive. Its presence in India is primarily through the import and domestic production of processed foods, catering to a growing demand for sugar-free and low-calorie options. It is not sourced from agriculture but manufactured industrially from beet sugar.

In Indian home kitchens, Isomalt is not a traditional ingredient. Its use is largely confined to contemporary culinary practices, particularly among those experimenting with sugar-free baking, confectionery, or specialized dietary preparations. Home bakers might use it to create sugar-free hard candies, decorative sugar work, or as a bulk sweetener in recipes where sugar reduction is desired, leveraging its stability and resistance to crystallization. However, it has not permeated the everyday cooking landscape of Indian households, which traditionally rely on natural sweeteners like jaggery, honey, or sucrose.

Industrially, Isomalt is a highly valued ingredient in the Indian food processing sector, especially in the burgeoning health and wellness segment. Its primary applications include sugar-free confectionery such as hard candies, chewing gums, chocolates, and baked goods. Its unique properties—low hygroscopicity (resistance to moisture absorption), high melting point, and excellent stability—make it ideal for products requiring a long shelf life and structural integrity, like decorative sugar art. It functions as a bulking agent, providing texture and mouthfeel similar to sugar, while contributing fewer calories and being non-cariogenic.

Consumers often confuse Isomalt with regular sugar (sucrose) or other artificial high-intensity sweeteners. While it provides sweetness and bulk like sugar, Isomalt is metabolized differently, resulting in a lower glycemic response and fewer calories (approximately 2 kcal/g compared to sugar's 4 kcal/g). It is also non-cariogenic, meaning it does not promote tooth decay, unlike sucrose. It should also be distinguished from high-intensity sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame, which are much sweeter than sugar and used in much smaller quantities, whereas Isomalt is a bulk sweetener providing volume and texture.
