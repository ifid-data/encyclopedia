Sweeteners are a broad category of food ingredients defined by their ability to impart a sweet taste. Historically, the human palate's affinity for sweetness led to the early adoption of natural sources like honey, fruit, and plant saps. In India, the cultivation of sugarcane dates back millennia, making jaggery (gur) and khand (unrefined sugar) integral to traditional diets and Ayurvedic practices. These indigenous sweeteners were not merely flavour agents but also considered sources of energy and medicinal properties, deeply embedded in cultural rituals and festive preparations across regions, from the jaggery-based sweets of Maharashtra to the date palm jaggery of Bengal.

In Indian home kitchens, sweeteners are fundamental to a vast array of culinary traditions. Beyond the ubiquitous sugar used in daily tea and coffee, traditional sweets like *ladoos*, *barfis*, *halwas*, and *kheer* rely on the precise balance of sweetness, often derived from sugar, jaggery, or condensed milk. Sweeteners also play a crucial role in balancing the complex flavour profiles of savoury dishes, such as in Gujarati *dal* or certain South Indian curries, where a touch of jaggery or sugar enhances the overall taste without making the dish overtly sweet.

The industrial food sector in India extensively utilizes a diverse range of sweeteners. Caloric sweeteners like refined sugar, liquid glucose, and high-fructose corn syrup provide bulk, texture, and preservation in products ranging from biscuits, confectionery, and beverages to jams and sauces. The rise of health consciousness has also propelled the use of non-caloric or artificial sweeteners (e.g., sucralose, aspartame) and natural alternatives (e.g., stevia, erythritol) in "sugar-free" or "diet" products, catering to consumers managing diabetes or weight. These are critical for formulating low-calorie beverages, dairy products, and baked goods, offering sweetness without the caloric load.

A common point of confusion arises from the broad term "sweetener" itself. While many consumers associate "sweetener" primarily with artificial, non-caloric sugar substitutes, the term scientifically encompasses any substance that imparts a sweet taste. This includes traditional caloric options like sucrose (table sugar), jaggery, honey, and fruit concentrates, alongside modern non-caloric alternatives. It is crucial to understand that "sweetener" is a functional classification, not an indicator of caloric content or natural origin, distinguishing it from the specific ingredient "sugar" which is a type of caloric sweetener.
