### Xylitol

Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol (polyol), was first isolated in the late 19th century. While not indigenous to India, its global recognition as a healthier sugar alternative has led to its increasing presence in the Indian market, particularly within health-conscious and diabetic-friendly product segments. It is found naturally in small amounts in many fruits, vegetables, and even in the human body. Industrially, xylitol is primarily extracted from xylan-rich plant materials such as birch wood and corn cobs, undergoing a hydrogenation process to convert xylose into xylitol. Its sourcing for the Indian market is predominantly through imports, catering to a growing demand for functional food ingredients.

In home kitchens, xylitol serves as a direct sugar substitute for those seeking to reduce caloric intake or manage blood sugar levels. Its granular form allows for easy integration into beverages, baked goods, and desserts, offering a sweetness profile comparable to sucrose. A notable characteristic of xylitol is its distinct cooling sensation on the tongue, which makes it particularly appealing in certain confections and oral care products. Its stability under heat also makes it suitable for cooking and baking without significant loss of sweetness.

Xylitol's unique properties make it a valuable ingredient in various industrial and modern applications. It is widely used in the FMCG sector, especially in sugar-free chewing gums, candies, and mints, owing to its non-cariogenic nature—it does not promote tooth decay. Beyond confectionery, it is incorporated into oral hygiene products like toothpastes and mouthwashes for its dental benefits. Its low glycemic index also makes it a preferred sweetener in diabetic-friendly foods and beverages, as it has a minimal impact on blood glucose levels.

Consumers often confuse xylitol with artificial sweeteners or other sugar alcohols. It is crucial to understand that xylitol is a polyol, a carbohydrate that is neither a sugar nor an artificial sweetener, but rather a natural compound. Unlike many artificial sweeteners, it offers a clean, sugar-like taste without a bitter aftertaste. While it shares the "sugar alcohol" classification with compounds like sorbitol and erythritol, xylitol is particularly distinguished by its proven dental health benefits. It is also important to note that while safe for human consumption, xylitol is highly toxic to dogs and should be kept out of their reach.
