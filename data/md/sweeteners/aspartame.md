Aspartame is a high-intensity artificial sweetener, chemically known as L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester. Discovered serendipitously in 1965 by chemist James M. Schlatter, it is a synthetic dipeptide composed of two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, with a methyl ester group. Unlike traditional sweeteners derived from plants, aspartame is entirely laboratory-synthesized. Its introduction to India, like many novel food additives, followed global trends in food technology and increasing consumer demand for low-calorie options, particularly from the late 20th century onwards. It has no traditional Indian linguistic roots or agricultural sourcing, being a product of modern chemical synthesis.

In Indian home kitchens, aspartame finds no place in traditional cooking methods due to its synthetic nature and heat instability. However, it is widely adopted by individuals managing diabetes or seeking to reduce caloric intake, often used as a tabletop sweetener in tea, coffee, or homemade beverages. It provides a clean, sugar-like taste without the associated calories, making it a popular choice for personal dietary management, though it is not typically incorporated into recipes requiring high-temperature cooking.

Industrially, aspartame is a cornerstone of the "sugar-free" and "diet" food and beverage segments in India. Its primary application is in products where intense sweetness is desired without the bulk or calories of sugar. This includes diet carbonated soft drinks, sugar-free chewing gums, instant beverage mixes, yogurts, and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Its functional property lies in its sweetness intensity, which is approximately 200 times that of sucrose, allowing for very small quantities to achieve desired sweetness levels. Due to its tendency to degrade at high temperatures or over extended periods in liquid, it is often incorporated into products that are not heat-processed or are consumed relatively quickly.

Consumers often encounter aspartame as a generic "artificial sweetener," leading to confusion with other high-intensity sweeteners like sucralose, saccharin, or stevia. While all serve to provide sweetness with minimal calories, aspartame has a distinct taste profile, often described as very similar to sugar, and specific stability characteristics. It is crucial to distinguish it from natural sweeteners like sugar or jaggery, as aspartame is a synthetic compound. Furthermore, its composition from amino acids means it is not suitable for individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder, a fact that mandates specific labeling on products containing it.
