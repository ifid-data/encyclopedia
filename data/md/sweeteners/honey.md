# Honey

Honey, known as *Madhu* in Sanskrit, holds a revered place in India's culinary, medicinal, and cultural heritage, dating back to Vedic times. Its mention in ancient texts like the Rigveda and Ayurveda underscores its significance as a natural sweetener and potent therapeutic agent. Traditionally, honey was sourced from wild bee colonies, a practice still observed in regions like the Sunderbans, while modern apiculture has expanded across states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, where diverse flora supports various honey types. The rich biodiversity of India, from Himalayan wildflowers to tropical blossoms, contributes to the unique flavour profiles of local honeys.

In Indian home kitchens, honey is primarily valued as a natural sweetener, often replacing refined sugar in beverages like tea, lemon water, or traditional health concoctions. It is drizzled over rotis, parathas, or desserts, and incorporated into marinades for meats or glazes for baked goods, imparting a distinct aroma and subtle sweetness. Its hygroscopic nature also makes it a natural humectant, contributing to moisture retention in traditional sweets and baked items, while its antimicrobial properties have long been leveraged in home remedies for coughs and colds.

Industrially, honey is a sought-after ingredient in the FMCG sector, particularly in health and wellness products. It is a key component in breakfast cereals, granola bars, yogurts, and a variety of health drinks, appealing to consumers seeking natural alternatives to artificial sweeteners. Beyond food, honey's emollient and antiseptic qualities make it a popular inclusion in cosmetics, skincare products, and pharmaceutical formulations, ranging from wound dressings to cough syrups, reflecting its versatile functional benefits.

Consumers often encounter different types of honey, leading to some confusion. "Blossom honey," the most common variety, is derived from the nectar of flowers, with its flavour and colour varying based on the floral source (e.g., multiflora, litchi, eucalyptus honey). "Honeydew honey," in contrast, is produced from the sugary excretions of plant-sucking insects, collected by bees, and typically has a darker colour and a less sweet, more robust flavour. A significant concern in the Indian market is the widespread adulteration of honey with sugar syrups (like rice syrup or jaggery syrup), making it crucial for consumers to distinguish pure, unadulterated honey from cheaper, processed alternatives, often by checking certifications or trusted brands.
