**Palm Sugar**

Palm sugar, known by various regional names such as *Taal Gur* (Bengali), *Karupatti* (Tamil), and *Eentha Gur* (Assamese), is a traditional unrefined sweetener derived from the sap of various palm trees. While its origins are often traced to Southeast Asia, its production and consumption have a long-standing heritage in coastal and eastern India, particularly in West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. The sap is meticulously collected by skilled tappers from the flower stalks of date palms (*Phoenix dactylifera* or *Phoenix sylvestris*), palmyra palms (*Borassus flabellifer*), or coconut palms (*Cocos nucifera*). This sap is then boiled down to a thick syrup, which solidifies upon cooling into blocks or is granulated into a coarse sugar.

In Indian home kitchens, palm sugar is highly valued for its distinct caramel-like flavour and earthy undertones, which are less intensely sweet than refined sugar. It is a staple in numerous traditional desserts, especially in regions like Bengal, where *Nolen Gur* (date palm jaggery) is a seasonal delicacy used in *pithas*, *sandesh*, and *payasam*. In South India, *Karupatti* finds its way into coffee, tea, and various sweet preparations, imparting a unique depth of flavour. Its unrefined nature means it retains some minerals and nutrients, making it a preferred choice for those seeking a more wholesome sweetener.

Commercially, palm sugar occupies a niche in the "natural" and "unrefined" sweetener market. While not as widely used in large-scale industrial food production as refined cane sugar due to its variable consistency and higher cost, it is increasingly found in artisanal products, health food bars, gourmet chocolates, and specialty beverages. Its unique flavour profile is also leveraged in premium confectionery and baked goods that aim for a more traditional or exotic taste. The growing consumer demand for natural ingredients has led to a modest increase in its industrial application within specific product categories.

Consumers often conflate "palm sugar" with "jaggery" (gud), leading to some confusion. While palm sugar is indeed a type of jaggery (specifically, jaggery derived from palm sap), the term "jaggery" more broadly refers to unrefined sugar products, most commonly made from sugarcane juice. Palm sugar is distinct from refined white sugar due to its minimal processing, which preserves its natural colour, flavour, and mineral content. It is also important to differentiate between the granulated form, often sold as "palm sugar," and the block form, commonly referred to as "palm jaggery," both originating from palm sap but differing in texture and presentation.
