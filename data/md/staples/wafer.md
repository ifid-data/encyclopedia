## Wafer

Wafers are thin, crisp, often sweet, and typically flat baked goods, distinguished by their characteristic patterned surface. While not indigenous to India, their origins trace back to medieval Europe, where they were initially baked between hot irons, much like their thicker cousin, the waffle. The term "wafer" itself is believed to derive from Old French "gaufrer," meaning to make a honeycomb pattern. Introduced to India primarily through colonial influence and later popularized by industrial confectionery, wafers have become a ubiquitous snack, manufactured by numerous domestic and international food companies across the country.

In Indian homes, wafers are predominantly consumed as a light snack, often accompanying tea or coffee. The plain, thin varieties are enjoyed for their delicate crunch, while cream-filled wafer biscuits, available in a myriad of flavours like chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, are a popular treat for children and adults alike. Wafer cones are an integral part of the Indian ice cream experience, providing a crisp, edible vessel for scoops of frozen delight, a practice deeply ingrained in the country's street food and dessert culture.

Industrially, wafers are a versatile component in the FMCG sector. Their thin, layered structure makes them ideal for creating multi-layered chocolate bars and confectionery, where they provide textural contrast and a satisfying crunch. Beyond snack biscuits, wafers are also used as bases for various dessert applications, in some breakfast cereals for added texture, and as a component in certain snack mixes. The precise control over their baking process allows for consistent thinness and crispness, crucial for their functional roles in mass-produced food items.

A common point of confusion arises between "wafer" and "waffle," particularly with the increasing popularity of waffles in India. While both are baked in patterned irons, wafers are characteristically thin, dry, and crisp, often layered and used as a biscuit or cone. Waffles, conversely, are typically thicker, softer, leavened, and served warm, often as a breakfast item with toppings. Furthermore, within the wafer family, "wafer biscuits" refer to the layered, cream-filled varieties, distinct from the simpler, unadorned "wafer cones" used for ice cream.
