**Buckwheat**

Buckwheat, known as *kuttu* in Hindi and *phapar* in Himalayan regions, is a pseudocereal originating from Central and East Asia, with its cultivation spreading across the globe over centuries. Despite its name, it is not related to wheat and is botanically classified as a fruit seed, making it a gluten-free alternative to true cereal grains. In India, buckwheat cultivation is predominantly found in the cooler climes of the Himalayan belt, including Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and parts of Jammu & Kashmir, where it has been a traditional staple for generations. Its resilience to harsh weather conditions and short growing season have made it a valuable crop in these mountainous regions.

In Indian home kitchens, buckwheat holds a unique and significant place, primarily as a staple for *vrat ka khana* (fasting food) during Hindu festivals like Navratri and Mahashivratri. Its non-cereal status makes it permissible during these periods. The most common culinary applications involve its flour, which is used to prepare *kuttu ki poori* (fried bread), *pakoras* (fritters), *cheela* (savory pancakes), and even *halwa* (sweet pudding). The whole groats are less common in traditional Indian cooking but can be used in porridges or as a rice substitute. Its distinct earthy flavour and hearty texture lend themselves well to these preparations.

Beyond traditional home cooking, buckwheat and its derivatives have found increasing favour in industrial and modern food applications, particularly within the health and wellness sector. Buckwheat flour is a key ingredient in the burgeoning gluten-free market, used in the production of gluten-free breads, pasta, and snack mixes. The whole groats are incorporated into breakfast cereals, energy bars, and as a nutritious component in various health food products. Industrially, buckwheat is valued for its high nutritional profile, including its rich content of dietary fiber, protein, and essential minerals, as well as antioxidants like rutin, which contributes to its functional food appeal.

A common point of confusion arises from buckwheat's name, which often leads consumers to mistakenly believe it is a type of wheat or a cereal grain. It is crucial to understand that buckwheat is a pseudocereal, botanically distinct from true cereals like wheat, rice, or maize. This distinction is fundamental to its use in *vrat ka khana*, where true grains are typically avoided. Furthermore, while used similarly during fasts, buckwheat (kuttu) should not be conflated with other fasting-friendly flours such as *singhara atta* (water chestnut flour) or *rajgira atta* (amaranth flour), each possessing its own unique botanical origin and flavour profile.
