Lupin, derived from the genus *Lupinus*, is an ancient legume with a rich history spanning the Mediterranean basin and the Andean highlands, where it has been cultivated for millennia. While not indigenous to traditional Indian agriculture or cuisine, its global prominence as a high-protein, high-fibre crop has led to its gradual introduction and exploration within India, primarily for its nutritional and functional properties. The name "lupin" itself originates from the Latin word "lupinus," meaning "wolf-like," possibly referring to its ability to thrive in poor soils. In India, its cultivation remains niche, with most commercial applications relying on imported varieties, though research into adapting it for local conditions is ongoing.

In Indian home kitchens, lupin is not a traditional staple like chickpeas or lentils. Its usage is largely confined to modern, health-conscious cooking, often by those exploring alternative protein sources or gluten-free diets. It can be found in forms like lupin flour, which can be incorporated into baked goods such as rotis, breads, or pancakes, or as whole seeds, which might be boiled and added to salads, stews, or even ground into a paste for vegan preparations. Its mild, slightly nutty flavour makes it versatile, though its distinct texture requires careful preparation to integrate into familiar Indian dishes.

Industrially, lupin is gaining traction in India's burgeoning health food and plant-based sectors. Lupin flour, rich in protein and dietary fibre, is a valuable ingredient in gluten-free products, high-protein snacks, and fortified foods. Its emulsifying and water-binding properties make it useful in bakery applications, meat analogues, and dairy alternatives, contributing to texture and nutritional enhancement. Lupin protein isolates are increasingly used in nutritional supplements, protein bars, and functional beverages, catering to the growing demand for plant-based protein sources among Indian consumers.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding lupin due to its relative unfamiliarity compared to common Indian pulses. It is crucial to distinguish edible "sweet lupin" varieties from "bitter lupin," which contains high levels of quinolizidine alkaloids and requires extensive processing to be safe for consumption. Unlike traditional Indian dals (like toor, moong, or chana), lupin is not typically consumed as a whole, cooked pulse in daily meals but rather as a processed ingredient or flour. Its unique nutritional profile, particularly its high protein and low carbohydrate content, sets it apart from other legumes, making it a distinct and valuable addition to modern Indian dietary considerations.
