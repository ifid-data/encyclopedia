**Sago**

Sago, known widely in India as *sabudana*, is a starch extracted from the pith of various tropical palm stems, most notably the sago palm (*Metroxylon sagu*) native to Southeast Asia. Its introduction to the Indian subcontinent likely occurred through ancient trade routes, becoming deeply integrated into local culinary traditions. The term "sabudana" itself is believed to be derived from "sabu," referring to sago, and "dana," meaning grain or pearl. While true sago palm cultivation for commercial sago production is limited in India, the vast majority of "sabudana" consumed domestically is derived from tapioca (cassava) starch, primarily produced in regions like Salem, Tamil Nadu, which has become a major hub for its processing.

In Indian home kitchens, sago holds a significant place, particularly as a staple during religious fasting (vrat or upvas) due to its easily digestible carbohydrate content and perceived purity. It is famously transformed into *Sabudana Khichdi*, a comforting, savoury dish, and *Sabudana Vada*, crispy fried patties. Beyond fasting, sago pearls are used to prepare sweet puddings, kheer, and porridges, often for infants and convalescents, owing to their bland flavour and soft texture when cooked. Sago powder, a finer form, can also be used as a thickening agent in gravies and soups.

Industrially, sago starch, whether from true sago or tapioca, is a versatile ingredient. Its neutral flavour and excellent thickening properties make it valuable in the FMCG sector as a binder, stabilizer, and texturizer in a range of processed foods, including instant soups, sauces, desserts, and baby foods. The powdered form is particularly suited for these applications, offering consistent viscosity and mouthfeel. Beyond food, sago starch finds applications in non-food industries such as textiles, paper manufacturing, and as an adhesive, leveraging its inherent polymeric structure.

A common point of confusion in India arises from the interchangeable use of "sago" and "tapioca pearls." While historically sago refers to the starch from the sago palm, the "sabudana" widely available and consumed in India is almost exclusively processed from tapioca (cassava) root starch. Both yield similar translucent pearls with comparable culinary applications, but their botanical origins differ. This distinction is crucial for understanding the ingredient's true source, though for most Indian consumers, "sabudana" universally refers to the tapioca-derived product.
