## Spelt

Spelt (*Triticum spelta*) is an ancient grain, a distinct species of wheat that originated in the Near East and was widely cultivated across Europe for millennia before being largely replaced by common wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) in the 19th and 20th centuries due to its lower yield and more challenging dehulling process. While not historically indigenous to India, spelt has seen a resurgence globally and is now finding a niche market within the country, primarily through organic farming initiatives and imports catering to health-conscious consumers. Its robust nature allows it to thrive in various climates, though large-scale cultivation in India remains limited, with most availability through specialty stores.

In Indian home kitchens, spelt is increasingly adopted as a healthier alternative to conventional wheat flour. Its flour can be used to prepare a variety of staples, including rotis, parathas, and baked goods like bread and cookies, imparting a slightly nutty, sweet flavour and a distinct texture. Whole spelt berries can also be cooked and incorporated into salads, porridges, or pilafs, offering a chewy texture and a rich, earthy taste. Its higher water absorption capacity often requires slight adjustments in traditional Indian recipes.

Industrially, spelt is a premium ingredient in India's burgeoning health food sector. It is processed into flour for organic bakeries producing artisanal breads, biscuits, and pasta. Its unique gluten structure, which is more water-soluble and often easier to digest for some individuals with mild wheat sensitivities (though it is not gluten-free), makes it a favoured choice for specialty food manufacturers. Spelt flakes and puffed spelt are also used in breakfast cereals and snack bars, marketed for their nutritional benefits, including higher fibre and protein content compared to modern wheat.

Consumers in India often encounter confusion regarding spelt, frequently conflating it with common wheat or other ancient grains like emmer or einkorn. While genetically related to wheat, spelt possesses a tougher outer husk that protects the kernel, contributing to its distinct nutritional profile and flavour. Crucially, while it contains gluten, its gluten structure differs from that of modern wheat, leading some individuals to find it more digestible. It is important to note that spelt is not suitable for those with celiac disease, despite its perceived "lighter" gluten.
