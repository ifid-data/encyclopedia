**Sorghum**

Sorghum, known widely in India as Jowar (Hindi), Cholam (Tamil), and Jonna (Telugu), is an ancient cereal grain with origins tracing back to Africa, cultivated for millennia. Its introduction to the Indian subcontinent is deeply rooted in antiquity, establishing it as a foundational staple, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions where its drought-resistant properties make it a resilient crop. Major cultivation hubs in India include Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where it thrives in challenging climatic conditions, playing a crucial role in food security for millions.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, sorghum is primarily consumed as a grain or flour. Its flour is famously used to prepare unleavened flatbreads known as 'bhakri' in Maharashtra and Karnataka, a nutritious alternative to wheat rotis. It is also incorporated into porridges, upma, and various regional snacks. Given its naturally gluten-free nature, sorghum has gained increasing popularity as a healthy alternative for individuals with gluten sensitivities, offering a good source of dietary fiber, protein, and essential minerals like iron and magnesium.

Beyond traditional culinary uses, sorghum has significant industrial and modern applications. Its flour is increasingly utilized in the FMCG sector for gluten-free baked goods, biscuits, and pasta. Industrially, sorghum is a vital component in animal feed formulations. A distinct variant, often referred to as "cane sorghum" or sweet sorghum, is cultivated specifically for its high sugar content in the stalks, which can be processed into syrup, jaggery, or fermented for ethanol production, serving as a renewable biofuel source. Sorghum malt is also used in brewing and as a functional ingredient in various food products.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the different forms and uses of sorghum. The most common form, grain sorghum (jowar), is primarily cultivated for its edible kernels used in food. However, "cane sorghum" or sweet sorghum, while botanically the same species, is specifically bred and grown for its sugar-rich stalks, not its grain, making it a source for sweeteners and biofuels. This distinction is crucial as their primary agricultural and industrial applications diverge significantly, even though both contribute to the versatility of the sorghum plant.
