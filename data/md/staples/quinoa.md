# Quinoa

Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah), botanically a seed from the *Chenopodium quinoa* plant, is a pseudo-cereal native to the Andean region of South America, where it has been a staple food for thousands of years. Revered by the Incas as "the mother of all grains," its cultivation primarily spans Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In India, quinoa is a relatively recent introduction, gaining prominence over the last decade as a "superfood" due to its exceptional nutritional profile. While not traditionally grown in India, its increasing demand has led to some experimental cultivation in regions with suitable climates, though most of the market supply remains imported.

In Indian home kitchens, quinoa is embraced as a versatile and healthier alternative to traditional grains like rice or wheat. Its mild, slightly nutty flavour and fluffy texture make it suitable for a variety of preparations. It is commonly used to prepare breakfast porridges, a gluten-free version of *upma*, or incorporated into salads, *khichdi*, and even *pulao*. Puffed quinoa, a lighter, airy form, finds its way into homemade granola, energy bars, or as a crunchy topping for yogurt and desserts, offering a textural contrast.

Industrially, quinoa's appeal as a gluten-free, protein-rich ingredient has led to its widespread adoption in the health and wellness sector. It is a key component in numerous FMCG products, including breakfast cereals, snack bars, and gluten-free baked goods like bread, cookies, and pasta. Quinoa flour is utilized in gluten-free baking mixes, while whole quinoa is incorporated into ready-to-eat meals and convenience foods. Puffed quinoa is particularly valued for its light texture and crispness, making it ideal for snack formulations and as an inclusion in breakfast cereals.

Consumers in India often encounter quinoa as a "new" grain, sometimes confusing its culinary role with traditional millets or even rice. It is crucial to understand that while it functions culinarily as a grain, quinoa is botanically a seed, making it a pseudo-cereal. This distinction is important for its unique nutritional composition, including being a complete protein source. Furthermore, whole quinoa, which requires cooking, should not be conflated with puffed quinoa, which is pre-processed and ready-to-eat, primarily used for texture and convenience in snacks and breakfast items rather than as a primary cooked staple.
