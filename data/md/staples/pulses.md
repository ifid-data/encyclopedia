# Pulses

Pulses, known colloquially across India as 'dal' (from Sanskrit 'dhal' meaning to split), represent the dried edible seeds of leguminous plants. Their history in the Indian subcontinent dates back millennia, forming an indispensable part of the traditional diet and agricultural landscape. India is both the largest producer and consumer of pulses globally, with major cultivation hubs in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. Beyond their nutritional value, pulses play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture through nitrogen fixation, enriching soil fertility naturally.

In the Indian home kitchen, pulses are a foundational staple, prepared daily in myriad forms. They are typically soaked, boiled, and then tempered with spices to create the ubiquitous 'dal' – a comforting and nutritious accompaniment to rice or roti. From the creamy Toor Dal (pigeon pea) and the earthy Urad Dal (black gram) to the versatile Moong Dal (green gram) and Chana Dal (Bengal gram), each variety lends distinct flavours and textures to dishes like sambar, rasam, curries, and khichdi. They are also sprouted for salads or ground into flours like 'besan' (chickpea flour) for pakoras, cheelas, and various sweets.

Industrially, pulses are processed into flours and starches for a wide array of modern food products. Besan, for instance, is a key ingredient in packaged snacks, savouries, and instant mixes for traditional Indian dishes. Pulse flours are increasingly used in gluten-free products, fortified foods, and as a source of plant-based protein in health supplements and meat alternatives. The convenience food sector leverages pre-cooked or ready-to-eat pulse preparations, catering to contemporary lifestyles while retaining the nutritional benefits.

A common point of confusion arises in distinguishing pulses from cereals or grains. While both are dietary staples, pulses are specifically the dried edible seeds of leguminous plants, characterized by their high protein and fibre content. Cereals, on the other hand, are grasses cultivated for their edible starchy grains, such as rice, wheat, or maize. Though often consumed together as part of a balanced meal, their botanical origins and primary nutritional profiles (pulses for protein, cereals for carbohydrates) are distinct.
