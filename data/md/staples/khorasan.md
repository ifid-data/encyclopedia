# Khorasan

Khorasan, scientifically known as *Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum*, is an ancient variety of wheat believed to have originated in the historical Khorasan region, encompassing parts of modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia. Its lineage traces back thousands of years, making it one of the oldest cultivated grains. While not indigenous to India, Khorasan wheat has recently garnered attention in the country's burgeoning health food market, imported primarily from North America and parts of Europe where it has been successfully revived and cultivated. Its re-discovery in the mid-20th century led to its commercialization under the brand name Kamut®, though "Khorasan" refers to the grain itself.

In home kitchens, Khorasan wheat is valued for its distinct nutty, buttery flavour and firm texture. It can be used as a whole grain in pilafs, salads, or as a hearty addition to soups, offering a more robust bite than common wheat. When milled into flour, it serves as an excellent alternative to conventional wheat flour for baking breads, making pasta, or preparing flatbreads like rotis and parathas, imparting a richer taste and often a slightly chewier texture. Its higher protein content also contributes to good dough structure.

Industrially, Khorasan wheat finds its niche in the premium and organic food sectors. It is processed into specialty flours for artisanal bakeries producing high-end breads, pastries, and pasta. Its unique flavour profile and nutritional benefits make it a popular ingredient in health-conscious breakfast cereals, snack bars, and gourmet ready-to-eat meals. The grain's robust nature also makes it suitable for various food processing applications where a distinct texture and flavour are desired, catering to consumers seeking ancient grain alternatives.

Consumers often confuse Khorasan wheat with common modern wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) or other ancient grains like Emmer or Spelt. Khorasan is distinguished by its significantly larger kernels, a more pronounced golden hue, and a characteristic rich, buttery, and nutty flavour profile, which is milder in modern wheat. Nutritionally, it typically boasts higher levels of protein, dietary fibre, and minerals like selenium and zinc compared to common wheat. While it contains gluten, some individuals with mild gluten sensitivities report better tolerance to Khorasan due to its different gluten structure, though it is not suitable for those with celiac disease.
