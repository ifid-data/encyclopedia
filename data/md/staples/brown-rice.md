Brown rice, known canonically as *brown rice*, represents the whole grain form of rice, retaining its bran and germ layers. While white rice, its more common counterpart, has been a staple across India for millennia, brown rice, with its distinct nutty flavour and chewy texture, has a deep-rooted, albeit often regional, presence in the subcontinent's agricultural and culinary heritage. Historically, various indigenous landraces of rice, particularly those cultivated by tribal communities or in specific ecological zones, were consumed in their unmilled or partially milled forms, aligning with the characteristics of brown rice. Major rice-growing states across India, from West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, cultivate varieties that can be processed into brown rice, though its commercial prominence as a distinct product is a more recent phenomenon driven by health consciousness.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, brown rice has historically been less prevalent than white rice due to its longer cooking time and firmer texture. However, it finds its way into wholesome preparations like *khichdi*, *pulao*, or as a healthier accompaniment to curries and dals, particularly in households prioritising nutritional benefits. Brown rice flakes, a processed form, are increasingly used to prepare quick, nutritious breakfast dishes similar to *poha* or as a base for porridges, offering convenience without sacrificing the whole grain goodness.

The industrial landscape has seen a significant surge in brown rice applications, particularly within the health and wellness segment of the FMCG sector. Its whole grain status makes it a preferred ingredient for breakfast cereals, energy bars, and gluten-free products. Brown rice flour is widely used in gluten-free baking and as a thickener, while brown rice syrup serves as a natural sweetener. The availability of brown rice in various forms, such as *whole grains brown rice* for direct consumption and *whole grains brown rice flakes* for instant preparations, caters to diverse consumer needs, from those seeking traditional cooking to those desiring quick, healthy meal solutions.

A common point of confusion arises when distinguishing brown rice from white rice. Brown rice is the unpolished grain, retaining the nutrient-rich bran and germ, which are removed during the milling process to produce white rice. This makes brown rice a whole grain, significantly higher in fibre, B vitamins, and minerals. Furthermore, *whole grains brown rice* refers to the intact grain, requiring longer cooking, whereas *whole grains brown rice flakes* are steamed and flattened for quicker preparation, offering a convenient option for instant meals while still delivering the nutritional benefits of the whole grain.
