Flour, a foundational ingredient in global and Indian cuisine, represents the finely ground meal of grains, legumes, or other starchy plant materials. Its history in India dates back millennia, with archaeological evidence pointing to the use of grinding stones for processing grains like wheat and barley in the Indus Valley Civilization. The term "flour" encompasses a vast array of products, with "atta" (whole wheat flour) and "maida" (refined wheat flour) being the most common in the Indian context, derived from wheat primarily grown in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Other significant flours include rice flour (chawal ka atta), chickpea flour (besan), and various millet flours (bajra, jowar, ragi), each deeply embedded in regional culinary traditions and linguistic heritage (e.g., "pindi" in Telugu, "maavu" in Kannada/Tamil).

In Indian home kitchens, flour is indispensable. Whole wheat flour (atta) is the cornerstone for daily staples like roti, chapati, puri, and paratha, forming the base of countless meals. Refined wheat flour (maida) is traditionally used for specific breads like naan and bhature, and in various sweets and fried snacks. Rice flour is crucial for South Indian delicacies such as dosa, idli, and appam, while besan (chickpea flour) is central to popular snacks like pakoras, bhajiyas, and the sweet boondi. Millet flours are increasingly valued for their nutritional profile, used in regional breads and porridges.

Industrially, flour is a primary raw material for India's vast food processing sector. Maida is extensively used in the production of biscuits, bread, cakes, noodles, and pasta, valued for its fine texture and gluten-forming properties. Specialized flours and modified starches derived from various grains find applications in thickening agents, batters for frozen foods, and as binders in processed meat alternatives. The functional properties of different flours, such as gluten strength in wheat flour for bakery products or the binding capacity of rice flour in gluten-free formulations, are critical for large-scale FMCG production, including ready-to-cook mixes and snack foods.

A common point of confusion in India lies in distinguishing between "atta" and "maida," both derived from wheat. Atta is whole wheat flour, retaining the bran, germ, and endosperm, making it richer in fiber and nutrients, and resulting in a denser, chewier texture. Maida, conversely, is refined wheat flour, where the bran and germ are removed, yielding a finer, whiter flour with less fiber and a softer texture, preferred for specific baked goods. Furthermore, the generic term "flour" is often conflated with "starch" (e.g., corn flour vs. corn starch). While flour contains starch, protein, and fiber, starch is a purified carbohydrate component, primarily used as a thickening agent, distinct from the comprehensive nutritional and functional profile of whole flours.
