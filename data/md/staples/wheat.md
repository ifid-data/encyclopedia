**Wheat**

Wheat (Triticum aestivum), known as 'gehun' in Hindi and 'godhuma' in Sanskrit, holds a venerable position in India's agricultural and culinary history, tracing its origins to the Fertile Crescent. Its cultivation in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization, establishing it as one of the earliest domesticated grains. Today, India stands as the world's second-largest producer, with vast fields spanning the northern plains, particularly in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. This ancient grain is a cultural cornerstone, deeply embedded in dietary patterns and rituals across diverse Indian communities.

In the Indian home kitchen, wheat is predominantly consumed in its milled form as 'atta' (whole wheat flour), which is fundamental to daily meals. It is the primary ingredient for ubiquitous flatbreads like rotis, chapatis, parathas, and puris, forming the backbone of North Indian cuisine. Beyond flatbreads, broken wheat, or 'dalia,' is a popular choice for nutritious porridges, upma, and savory pilafs. Finer forms, like 'wheat cream' or semolina, are used in sweets such as halwa or savory preparations. Wheat crispies and flakes are increasingly incorporated into snacks or breakfast options.

The versatility of wheat makes it a cornerstone of the modern Indian food industry. Its flour is extensively used in the production of a wide array of FMCG products, including biscuits, breads, cakes, pasta, and noodles. Malted wheat, a processed form, is valued for its enzymatic activity, aiding dough conditioning and imparting distinct flavor and color to baked goods and beverages. Wheat bran, a rich source of dietary fiber, is incorporated into fortified foods and health products. Wheat flakes and crispies are staple components of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and snack mixes.

A common point of confusion for consumers in India lies in distinguishing between "whole wheat" and "refined wheat flour" (maida). While both originate from the wheat grain, whole wheat flour retains the bran, germ, and endosperm, offering a higher nutritional profile rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Maida, conversely, is produced by removing the bran and germ, resulting in a finer, whiter flour with a longer shelf life but significantly reduced nutritional value. It is crucial to understand that 'wheat bran' is a component of the whole grain, often separated and sold as a fiber supplement. Wheat should also be differentiated from other staple grains like barley or millets, which possess unique nutritional compositions and culinary applications.
