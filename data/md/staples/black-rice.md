Black rice, known as 'Chak-hao' in Manipur and 'Karuppu Kavuni' in Tamil Nadu, boasts a rich history, often referred to as "Forbidden Rice" due to its historical exclusivity to Chinese emperors. Its journey to India is deeply rooted in the country's northeastern states, particularly Manipur, where it has been cultivated for centuries and holds significant cultural importance. Beyond the Northeast, varieties are also grown in parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Odisha, thriving in specific agro-climatic conditions. The distinctive dark hue of black rice is attributed to its high anthocyanin content, the same powerful antioxidant found in blueberries and blackberries, making it a prized grain for its nutritional profile.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, black rice is celebrated for its unique texture and nutty flavour, often reserved for special occasions and festive preparations. In Manipur, Chak-hao Kheer, a rich and aromatic pudding, is a staple dessert. Similarly, in Tamil Nadu, Karuppu Kavuni Arisi Payasam is a cherished sweet dish. Its longer cooking time and requirement for pre-soaking mean it's not a daily staple like white rice but is increasingly appreciated as a healthier alternative in various preparations, from savoury pilafs and salads to wholesome porridges.

Modern industrial applications for black rice are emerging, driven by its superfood status and vibrant natural colour. It is increasingly found in health-focused FMCG products such as gourmet breakfast cereals, multi-grain mixes, and specialty flours. Its high antioxidant content makes it attractive for functional food formulations, while its natural pigmentation offers potential as a food colourant, providing a healthier alternative to artificial dyes. High-end restaurants and health food cafes also feature black rice prominently in their menus, catering to a growing consumer demand for nutritious and visually appealing ingredients.

Consumers often confuse black rice with other pigmented rice varieties or simply overlook its distinct characteristics compared to common white or brown rice. The primary distinction lies in its deep purple-black colour, which is a direct indicator of its high anthocyanin content, a powerful antioxidant largely absent in white rice and less concentrated in brown rice. Unlike brown rice, which is simply de-hulled, black rice possesses a unique flavour profile—nutty and slightly sweet—and a chewier texture. It is also significantly richer in fibre, protein, and iron, offering a superior nutritional profile that sets it apart as a distinct and beneficial whole grain.
