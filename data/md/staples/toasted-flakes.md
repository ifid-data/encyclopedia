Toasted flakes represent a category of processed grains, primarily cereals, that have undergone a roasting or toasting process and are presented in a flattened, flaked form. While the concept of flaked grains has ancient roots in various cultures, the modern "toasted flake" as a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal emerged in the late 19th century in the Western world. Its introduction to India, largely through colonial influence and later globalization, positioned it as a convenient, albeit non-traditional, breakfast option. The grains used, such as corn, wheat, rice, and oats, are widely cultivated across India, with states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra being significant producers of these staple cereals.

In Indian home kitchens, toasted flakes are predominantly consumed as a breakfast item, typically served with milk, sugar, and sometimes fresh fruits or nuts. Unlike traditional Indian breakfast staples like poha (flattened rice), upma, or idli, which often involve cooking, toasted flakes offer a quick, no-cook alternative. While not deeply integrated into traditional Indian culinary practices, some contemporary home cooks might incorporate them into fusion snacks, as a crunchy topping for desserts, or as a binding agent in certain cutlets, leveraging their crisp texture.

Industrially, toasted flakes are a cornerstone of the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal market, a significant segment within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector in India. Manufacturers process various grains into flakes, which are then toasted to achieve their characteristic crispness and flavour. This toasting process (E-ROASTED) enhances palatability and shelf-stability. The M-FLAKES form is ideal for packaging and convenient consumption, often fortified with vitamins and minerals to boost nutritional value. Beyond breakfast cereals, toasted flakes are also incorporated into granola bars, muesli mixes, and snack formulations, providing texture and a wholesome base.

Consumers often use "toasted flakes" as a generic term, which can lead to confusion regarding the specific grain used. For instance, "corn flakes" are a type of toasted flake, distinct from "wheat flakes" or "oat flakes," each possessing unique flavour profiles and nutritional compositions. It is also important to distinguish toasted flakes from their un-toasted counterparts, such as raw rolled oats or flattened rice (poha) before it is roasted or tempered. The toasting process fundamentally alters the texture and flavour, making them ready for direct consumption, unlike raw flakes which typically require further cooking.
