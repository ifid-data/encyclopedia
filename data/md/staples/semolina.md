Semolina, known widely across India as Rava or Sooji, is a coarse, purified middling of durum wheat. Its name, derived from the Italian *semolino*, reflects its granular texture, while its Indian appellations, Rava (from Marathi/Konkani) and Sooji (from Hindi/Urdu), are deeply embedded in the subcontinent's culinary lexicon. Though primarily associated with durum wheat, semolina can also be produced from other grains. Wheat cultivation, and consequently semolina production, has a long and rich history in India, with major sourcing regions spanning the wheat-growing belts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.

In Indian home kitchens, semolina is a remarkably versatile staple, celebrated for its ability to absorb liquids and create diverse textures. It is the foundation for beloved breakfast and snack items like *Upma* and *Rava Dosa* in the South, and the sweet, comforting *Halwa* or *Sheera* in the North. Its granular nature lends itself well to tempering, providing a delightful bite in savory preparations, while its capacity to swell makes it ideal for fluffy, moist desserts. Specific varieties like "Idli Rava" are tailored for traditional fermented dishes, contributing to the characteristic texture of *Idli*.

Beyond traditional home cooking, semolina finds extensive application in the modern food industry. Its functional properties, particularly its varying grind sizes, make it a key ingredient in numerous FMCG products. Fine semolina is often used in baking for cakes, cookies, and puddings, while coarser grades are preferred for pasta production, providing the necessary structure and bite. It is also a common component in instant mixes for *Upma*, *Idli*, and *Dosa*, as well as in breakfast cereals and baby food formulations, valued for its nutritional profile and ease of digestion.

A common point of confusion arises from the interchangeable use of "Semolina," "Rava," and "Sooji" in India. While "semolina" is the technical term for the coarse wheat middlings, "rava" and "sooji" are its widely accepted regional synonyms, often differentiated by their grind size (fine, medium, or coarse). For instance, "Bansi Rawa" typically refers to a coarser variety, while "Idli Rava" is specifically processed for *Idli* preparation, sometimes involving parboiled wheat. It is crucial to understand that these terms generally refer to the same core ingredient, with variations primarily indicating texture or intended culinary use rather than a fundamentally different product.
