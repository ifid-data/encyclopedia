**Horsegram**

Horsegram, known by various regional names such as *Kulthi* (Hindi), *Gahat* (Uttarakhand), *Hurali* (Kannada), *Kollu* (Tamil), and *Ulavalu* (Telugu), is an ancient legume with deep roots in Indian agriculture and culinary heritage. Believed to be one of the oldest cultivated pulses, its origins trace back to the Indian subcontinent, where it has been grown for millennia. This drought-resistant crop thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, making it a staple in dryland farming areas, particularly across South India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu) and parts of the Himalayan foothills. Its resilience and nutritional density have cemented its place in the diets of rural communities.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, horsegram is prized for its robust, earthy flavour and warming properties, especially during colder months. It is commonly prepared as a hearty dal, a thick soup (*kulith saar* or *rasam*), or ground into flour to make nutritious flatbreads (*roti*) or savoury pancakes (*adai* and *dosa*). Sprouted horsegram is also incorporated into salads or stir-fries, enhancing its digestibility and nutrient availability. Its distinct taste and texture offer a welcome variation from more common lentils, often featuring in regional specialities that highlight its unique character.

While not as extensively processed as major pulses, horsegram is gaining traction in modern industrial applications due to its exceptional nutritional profile. It is increasingly being explored for health-focused food products, including protein powders, fortified flours, and ready-to-eat snacks. Its high protein, iron, calcium, and fibre content make it an attractive ingredient for functional foods targeting wellness and dietary supplementation. Historically, as its name suggests, it was also used as feed for horses and cattle, a practice that continues in some regions, though its primary focus has shifted towards human consumption.

Consumers often encounter horsegram as a small, reddish-brown lentil, sometimes leading to confusion with other common dals like moong or masoor. However, horsegram stands apart with its unique nutritional density, boasting higher levels of protein, iron, and calcium compared to many other legumes. It is also traditionally revered in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits, including aiding in weight management and supporting kidney health. The "horse" in its name refers to its historical use as animal feed, but it is crucial to recognize its significant and growing role as a highly nutritious and culturally significant food for human consumption in India.
