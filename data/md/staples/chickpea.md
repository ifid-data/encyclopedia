**Chickpea**

The chickpea, known in India primarily as *chana* (चना) or *chole* (छोले), boasts an ancient lineage, with archaeological evidence tracing its origins to the Middle East over 7,500 years ago. Introduced to the Indian subcontinent millennia ago, it quickly became a cornerstone of the diet, deeply interwoven with the nation's culinary and agricultural heritage. India is the world's largest producer of chickpeas, with major cultivation concentrated in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh. Two primary varieties dominate: the larger, lighter-coloured 'Kabuli Chana' (often associated with Afghanistan's Kabul region) and the smaller, darker, rough-coated 'Desi Chana' (meaning 'local' or 'native'), also known as 'Kala Chana'.

In Indian home kitchens, chickpeas are incredibly versatile. Whole Kabuli Chana is famously the star of *Chole Bhature*, a popular North Indian dish, and features in numerous curries, salads, and stews. Desi Chana, with its earthier flavour and firmer texture, is often used in dry preparations, sprouts, or as a protein-rich snack. When split and dehusked, Desi Chana becomes *Chana Dal*, a staple lentil used in various dals, tempering, and sweets. Its flour, *Besan*, is indispensable for making *pakoras*, *cheela*, *dhokla*, *kadhi*, and as a binding agent in many savoury snacks, even finding use in traditional beauty remedies.

Industrially, chickpeas and their derivatives are vital to the Indian food processing sector. Besan is a key ingredient in a vast array of packaged snacks like *bhujia*, *sev*, and other fried savouries, valued for its crisping properties and distinct flavour. Canned chickpeas offer convenience for ready-to-eat meals and are increasingly used in modern plant-based food products, including vegan alternatives and gluten-free pasta, leveraging its high protein and fibre content. Its functional properties make it a valuable ingredient in formulating healthier snack options and meat analogues.

Consumers often encounter confusion regarding the different forms of chickpeas. The term "chickpea" is the overarching botanical name, encompassing both the large, pale 'Kabuli Chana' and the smaller, darker 'Desi Chana' (also known as 'Kala Chana'). While both are chickpeas, their distinct appearances, textures, and cooking times lead to varied culinary applications. Furthermore, 'Chana Dal' refers specifically to the split and dehusked form of Desi Chana, and 'Besan' is the flour derived from it. It is important to recognise these distinctions to ensure appropriate usage in recipes, as they are not interchangeable in all contexts.
