Millets are diverse, small-seeded grasses, cultivated globally as cereal crops. Originating over 7,000 years ago in Asia and Africa, they hold profound historical and cultural significance in India, often termed "ancient grains" or "nutri-cereals." Their resilience, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in marginal soils made them a cornerstone of traditional Indian agriculture, predating widespread rice and wheat adoption. Major producing states include Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The term encompasses distinct varieties like Jowar (Sorghum), Bajra (Pearl Millet), and Ragi (Finger Millet), deeply embedded in India's heritage.

Historically, millets formed the primary dietary staple for much of the Indian populace, especially in arid regions. In traditional home kitchens, they are prepared in myriad ways. Bajra (Pearl Millet) flour makes thick, rustic rotis, a winter favourite in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Jowar (Sorghum) flour yields soft rotis and bhakris in Maharashtra. Ragi (Finger Millet), a nutritional powerhouse, is ground for Karnataka's ragi mudde, rotis, or fermented into nutritious porridge (ragi malt) for infants. Other varieties like Foxtail, Kodo, Little, and Barnyard millets are used for upma, khichdi, and rice-like preparations, imparting distinct textures and earthy flavours.

The contemporary food industry has seen a significant resurgence in millet usage, driven by their exceptional nutritional profile and gluten-free properties. FMCG companies extensively incorporate millets into various products. Millet flakes (jowar, foxtail) are processed into breakfast cereals, muesli, and granola bars. Millet flours (mixed, foxtail, bajra, ragi) are crucial ingredients in gluten-free baked goods, health mixes, and fortified foods. Their high fibre, low glycemic index, and rich mineral composition make them ideal for functional foods, baby food formulations, and a range of processed snacks, catering to health-conscious consumers.

"Millet" is a broad term for diverse grains, not a singular crop. Consumers often mistakenly interchange or conflate different millet types, overlooking their unique characteristics. Jowar (Sorghum), Bajra (Pearl Millet), and Ragi (Finger Millet) are distinct grains, each with specific nutritional compositions, textures, and optimal culinary applications. While all are gluten-free and nutrient-dense, their individual properties dictate their best use. Pseudocereals like Quinoa, though often grouped with millets due to similar health benefits, are botanically different; millets are true grasses, whereas quinoa is a broadleaf plant.
