# Multigrain

Multigrain, as a defined product category, is a modern concept driven by a global emphasis on diverse and nutrient-rich diets. However, the practice of consuming multiple grains is deeply rooted in India's culinary heritage. Historically, Indian diets were inherently "multigrain," with regional staples like wheat, rice, and various millets (jowar, bajra, ragi) consumed alongside barley and other indigenous grains. This traditional diversity was driven by local agricultural practices and nutritional wisdom. The contemporary "multigrain" trend in India reflects a re-embrace of this ancient wisdom, often incorporating a blend of locally sourced grains to offer a broader spectrum of nutrients.

In traditional Indian homes, the consumption of different grains was often seasonal and regional, used for various flatbreads (rotis, bhakris), porridges, and gruels. Today, "multigrain" has found its way into modern home kitchens primarily as composite flours for healthier rotis, parathas, and breads. Multigrain breakfast cereals, including "multigrain flakes" and blends like "multigrain mix oats," are popular choices. These blends are also incorporated into homemade snacks, energy bars, and savory dishes to enhance their nutritional profile and textural complexity.

The industrial food sector has widely adopted multigrain formulations due to consumer demand for healthier options. Multigrain products are prevalent across various FMCG categories, including breads, biscuits, pasta, breakfast cereals (especially "multigrain flakes"), and snack foods. Food technologists leverage the diverse properties of different grains – for instance, wheat for gluten structure, oats for soluble fiber, and millets for their unique micronutrient profiles – to create products with enhanced nutritional value, improved texture, and appealing flavor. Multigrain blends are also used in health supplements and fortified foods.

A common point of confusion for consumers is the distinction between "multigrain" and "whole grain." While a "multigrain" product simply means it contains more than one type of grain, it does not automatically imply that these grains are "whole grains" (i.e., containing the bran, germ, and endosperm). A product can be multigrain but still made from refined grains. Conversely, a product can be "whole grain" but only contain one type of grain (e.g., 100% whole wheat bread). Consumers should look for labels explicitly stating "100% whole grain" in addition to "multigrain" if they seek the full nutritional benefits of unrefined grains.
