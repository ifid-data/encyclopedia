The moth bean, known scientifically as *Vigna aconitifolia*, is a resilient legume deeply embedded in the culinary and agricultural landscape of India, particularly in its arid and semi-arid regions. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, its cultivation dates back millennia, making it a heritage crop. Linguistically, it is widely recognized as 'moth' in Hindi, 'matki' in Marathi, and 'dew bean' or 'tepary bean' in English, reflecting its widespread presence across states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, where its drought-resistant nature makes it a vital food source.

In traditional Indian home kitchens, moth beans are celebrated for their earthy flavour and versatility. The whole beans are commonly sprouted and used to prepare nutritious salads, or cooked into hearty curries and *dals*, such as the popular Maharashtrian *usal*. Moth bean flour, derived from grinding the dried beans, is a staple for making various fritters (*pakoras*), flatbreads, and as a thickening agent in gravies, lending a distinct texture and nutritional boost to dishes.

While not as extensively industrialized as some other pulses, moth beans and their flour find niche applications in modern food processing. The whole beans are increasingly incorporated into health-focused ready-to-eat snack mixes and sprouted grain blends, appealing to consumers seeking high-protein, fibre-rich options. Moth bean flour is also utilized in some gluten-free flour blends and as a component in savoury *namkeen* products, contributing to their characteristic crunch and flavour profile.

Consumers often encounter moth beans in two primary forms: the whole dried bean and its flour. It is important to distinguish between these, as their culinary applications differ significantly. The whole bean requires soaking and cooking, often sprouting, to be palatable, while the flour is ready for immediate use in batters and doughs. While sharing some visual similarities with other small lentils like *moong dal* (green gram), moth beans possess a unique, slightly more robust and earthy flavour, and a distinct texture when cooked, setting them apart from their legume cousins.
