**Milk Protein**

Milk, revered as "Gau Mata" in India, has been an indispensable part of the subcontinent's diet and culture for millennia. Its proteins, essential for sustenance, have been consumed in various forms since ancient times, deeply embedded in Ayurvedic principles. While isolating "milk protein" as a distinct ingredient is a modern technological development, traditional Indian dairy practices, like making paneer, inherently involve the coagulation and concentration of milk proteins, primarily casein. India, the world's largest milk producer, primarily sources milk from cows and buffaloes, forming the foundational raw material for both traditional products and contemporary protein extraction.

In the traditional Indian home kitchen, milk protein is consumed holistically as part of milk and its derivatives, not as an isolated ingredient. Dishes like paneer, a vegetarian staple, are direct manifestations of coagulated casein, offering a rich protein source. Other preparations like khoa (reduced milk solids), dahi (curd), and various sweets (mithai) also deliver milk proteins in their natural matrix. These forms are integral to daily meals, festive preparations, and religious offerings, valued for their nutritional density, texture, and flavour.

Modern food technology enables the extraction and concentration of milk proteins for diverse industrial applications. Milk Protein Concentrate (MPC) and Milk Protein Isolate (MPI) are widely used in the FMCG sector, particularly in sports nutrition products like protein powders and bars, infant formulas, and fortified dairy beverages, owing to their high protein content and functional properties. Casein, specifically, is prized for its slow-digesting nature (micellar casein) in nutritional supplements and its excellent emulsifying, gelling, and thickening capabilities. Rennet casein finds extensive use in processed cheese manufacturing and other food systems requiring specific textural attributes.

A common confusion arises from the various terms associated with milk proteins. "Milk Protein" is a broad umbrella term encompassing all proteins naturally present in milk, primarily casein (approximately 80%) and whey. "Milk Protein Concentrate" (MPC) refers to a processed dairy ingredient where water, lactose, and some minerals are removed, resulting in a higher protein percentage. "Casein" itself is a family of phosphoproteins, known for forming micelles. "Micellar casein" is the natural, undenatured form, prized for its slow amino acid release. "Rennet casein" is casein precipitated through enzymatic action, commonly used in cheese production and industrial applications.
