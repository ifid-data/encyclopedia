Buttermilk, known across India as *chaas*, *mattha*, or *moru*, holds a venerable place in the subcontinent's culinary and cultural heritage. Its origins are deeply intertwined with traditional dairy practices, emerging as a natural byproduct when butter is churned from fermented cream or yogurt. This ancient beverage is mentioned in Ayurvedic texts for its cooling properties and digestive benefits, suggesting its consumption dates back millennia. Linguistically, "chaas" is derived from the Sanskrit "chacchika," highlighting its deep roots. Historically, it was a staple in rural households, providing a nutritious and refreshing drink, particularly in the hot Indian climate, and remains widely consumed in dairy-rich regions from Punjab to Gujarat and down to Kerala.

In the Indian home kitchen, buttermilk is far more than just a beverage. It is a cornerstone ingredient, especially in regional cuisines. As a cooling drink, *chaas* is often seasoned with salt, roasted cumin powder, ginger, and fresh coriander, sometimes with a tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves. Its tangy profile makes it an excellent base for traditional dishes like *kadhi*, a popular yogurt-based curry thickened with gram flour. It also serves as a tenderizer for meats and a leavening agent in various breads and pancakes, imparting a distinct sour note and aiding in digestion due to its probiotic nature.

Modern food processing has expanded buttermilk's applications significantly. Industrially, buttermilk is often produced by culturing skim milk with lactic acid bacteria, mimicking the traditional fermentation process. Buttermilk powder, a dehydrated form, is widely used in the FMCG sector for its convenience and extended shelf life. It is a key ingredient in commercial baked goods, such as muffins, pancakes, and biscuits, where it contributes to moisture, tenderness, and leavening. It also finds its way into salad dressings, marinades, and various processed dairy and snack products, valued for its emulsifying properties and characteristic tangy flavour.

A common point of confusion arises from the distinction between traditional buttermilk and its commercially produced counterparts. Traditional buttermilk is the thin, slightly acidic liquid left after churning butter from whole milk or cream, often containing residual fat globules. In contrast, commercially available "cultured buttermilk" is typically made by adding a bacterial culture to skim or low-fat milk, resulting in a thicker, more uniform product. "Reconstituted buttermilk" refers to buttermilk made from buttermilk powder mixed with water. While all share a similar tangy profile, their texture and fat content can vary significantly, impacting their functional use in cooking and industrial applications.
