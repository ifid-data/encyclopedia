# Khoa

Khoa, also widely known as Mawa, is a foundational dairy product indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, deeply embedded in its culinary heritage. Its origins trace back centuries, born from the necessity of preserving milk by reducing its water content through slow evaporation. The term "Khoa" is prevalent in Hindi and Urdu, while "Mawa" is commonly used in Marathi and Gujarati, and "Khoya" in Bengali, reflecting its widespread presence across diverse linguistic regions. Traditionally, it is prepared by simmering full-fat milk in large, open iron woks (karahis) over a slow fire, stirring continuously until most of the moisture evaporates, leaving behind concentrated milk solids. Major producing regions include Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, where dairy farming is a significant agricultural activity.

In home kitchens, Khoa is the quintessential base for an extensive array of traditional Indian sweets, or *mithai*. Its rich, creamy texture and distinct caramelised milk flavour are indispensable for preparations like *Gulab Jamun*, *Barfi*, *Peda*, *Gujiya*, and *Kalakand*. Depending on the desired final texture of the sweet, different types of Khoa are used: *Batti* (hard, dense) for grating, *Chikna* (soft, smooth) for kneading into doughs, and *Daandedaar* (granular) for crumbly sweets. It imparts a unique richness and body that cannot be replicated by other dairy products, making it central to festive and celebratory culinary traditions.

Industrially, Khoa is a critical ingredient for commercial sweet manufacturers, bakeries, and even some savoury food producers seeking to enrich gravies or fillings. Modern production methods often employ vacuum evaporators or continuous Khoa-making machines to ensure consistency, hygiene, and scalability, moving beyond the labour-intensive traditional open-pan method. Furthermore, dried Khoa powder has emerged as a convenient alternative for the FMCG sector, offering extended shelf life and ease of reconstitution, facilitating large-scale production and distribution of Khoa-based products.

Consumers often encounter confusion when distinguishing Khoa from other concentrated milk products. Unlike *Paneer*, which is an acid-coagulated cheese with a firm, crumbly texture primarily used in savoury dishes, Khoa is unsweetened evaporated milk solids, softer and richer, and predominantly used in sweets. It also differs from *Condensed Milk*, which contains added sugar and is not evaporated to the same dry solids content, lacking Khoa's characteristic cooked milk flavour and texture. Similarly, while *Milk Powder* is also dried milk, it is typically spray-dried and lacks the unique caramelised flavour and granular texture developed through Khoa's slow, heat-intensive evaporation process.
