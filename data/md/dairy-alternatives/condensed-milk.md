**Condensed Milk**

Condensed milk, a product of dairy innovation, traces its origins to the mid-19th century, notably patented by Gail Borden in the United States. Its development was driven by the need for a shelf-stable milk product, particularly for military provisions and long voyages. While not indigenous to India, it was introduced during the colonial era and gained significant traction post-independence as a convenient, preserved dairy option. The term "condensed milk" itself is English, reflecting its foreign origin, and it is produced by evaporating water from milk, often cow's milk, and then adding sugar to create a thick, viscous product. Major dairy-producing regions across India now contribute to its manufacturing, with milk sourced from local dairy farms.

In Indian home kitchens, condensed milk has become an indispensable ingredient, particularly in the realm of desserts and beverages. Its rich, sweet, and creamy texture makes it a popular choice for preparing traditional sweets like kheer, payasam, halwa, and various barfis, where it acts as both a sweetener and a thickener, imparting a distinctive richness. It is also widely used in homemade ice creams, custards, and puddings, simplifying recipes by eliminating the need for separate milk reduction and sugar addition. In South India, it finds its way into strong filter coffee, offering a luxurious, sweet dairy note.

Industrially, condensed milk is a cornerstone in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. It is extensively utilized in confectionery for chocolates, toffees, and fudges, and in the bakery industry for cakes, cookies, and fillings, providing sweetness, moisture, and a desirable texture. Its functional properties extend to being an emulsifier and a source of concentrated milk solids, making it valuable in ready-to-drink beverages and various processed dairy products. Manufacturers often employ different forms, such as sweetened condensed skimmed milk or partly skimmed milk, to control the fat content and caloric profile of their final products, catering to diverse consumer preferences and nutritional requirements.

A common point of confusion arises between "condensed milk" and "evaporated milk." While both are milk concentrates, condensed milk is always sweetened, containing a significant amount of added sugar, which also contributes to its preservation and thick consistency. Evaporated milk, conversely, is unsweetened and typically less viscous. In the Indian context, when one refers to "condensed milk," it almost invariably implies the sweetened variety. Further distinctions exist within condensed milk itself, such as full-fat, skimmed, or partly skimmed versions, which vary in their fat content but retain the characteristic sweetness and concentration.
