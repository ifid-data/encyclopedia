**Milk Products**

Milk products, broadly encompassing all derivatives of animal milk, hold an unparalleled position in India's culinary, cultural, and economic landscape. Their heritage traces back to the Vedic period, where milk from cows was revered as sacred and essential for sustenance and rituals. India, being the world's largest milk producer, primarily relies on cow and buffalo milk, with regional variations including goat and camel milk. Traditional methods of processing, such as curdling, churning, and heating, have been passed down through generations, forming the bedrock of Indian dairy practices.

In Indian home kitchens, milk products are indispensable. Curd (dahi) is a daily staple, consumed plain, as buttermilk (chaas), or in raitas. Ghee (clarified butter) is revered for its flavour and nutritional value, used for tempering, frying, and enriching a myriad of dishes, from dals to desserts. Paneer, a fresh cheese, is a versatile protein source in vegetarian curries and snacks. Khoa (reduced milk solids) forms the base for countless traditional sweets (mithai), while fresh milk is consumed directly, used in tea, coffee, and various sweet preparations.

The industrial sector has significantly scaled up the production and diversification of milk products. Large-scale dairies produce pasteurized milk, curd, paneer, butter, and cheese, making them accessible nationwide. The FMCG sector leverages milk solids in products like ice cream, yogurt, condensed milk, and dairy whiteners. Furthermore, milk proteins like whey and caseinates are vital functional ingredients in sports nutrition, infant formulas, and processed foods, showcasing the technological advancements in dairy processing.

Consumers often use "milk products" and "dairy" interchangeably, referring to items derived directly from milk. However, it's crucial to distinguish these from "dairy flavourings," which are synthetic or natural compounds designed to mimic the taste of dairy without containing actual milk solids. While milk products offer nutritional benefits and functional properties inherent to milk, dairy flavourings serve purely as taste enhancers in non-dairy or dairy-reduced formulations. This distinction is vital for those with dietary restrictions or seeking authentic dairy experiences.
