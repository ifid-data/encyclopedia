# Cream

Cream, in its broadest sense, refers to the fat-rich layer that rises to the surface of unhomogenized milk. This dairy product has been an integral part of human diets and culinary traditions since the domestication of livestock. In India, the concept of 'malai' – the thick, clotted cream formed by simmering milk – predates modern industrial cream production and is deeply embedded in traditional cooking and cultural practices. While historically sourced from buffalo and cow milk across all dairy-producing regions of India, commercial cream is now predominantly derived from cow's milk, separated centrifugally to achieve desired fat percentages.

In Indian home kitchens, fresh cream is a versatile ingredient, lending richness and body to a myriad of dishes. It is a cornerstone of many North Indian gravies, such as *paneer makhani* and *malai kofta*, where it contributes to the characteristic creamy texture and mild sweetness. It is also used extensively in desserts, from enriching *kheer* and *rabri* to forming the base for homemade *kulfi*. Whipped cream, though a more Western application, has found its way into Indian bakeries and cafes for decorating cakes and beverages. Sour cream, with its tangy profile, is less traditional but is increasingly used in contemporary Indian fusion cuisine for dips and dressings.

Industrially, cream and its derivatives are vital to the FMCG sector. Fresh cream is a key ingredient in the production of ice creams, yogurts, and various dairy-based desserts, providing essential fat content and mouthfeel. Cultured cream, including sour cream, is utilized in processed foods like salad dressings, dips, and snack seasonings for its characteristic tang and emulsifying properties. Sweet cream powder, a dehydrated form of fresh cream, offers a convenient, shelf-stable dairy fat source for instant mixes, bakery products, confectionery, and as a flavour enhancer in various food formulations where liquid cream's perishability or water content is a concern.

Consumers often encounter various forms of cream, leading to some confusion. Fresh cream, typically sold in cartons, is unfermented and sweet. Sour cream and cultured cream, however, are fermented with lactic acid bacteria, resulting in a thicker texture and a distinct tangy flavour due to increased acidity. While *malai* is the traditional Indian equivalent, it differs from commercial fresh cream in its preparation (slow heating vs. centrifugal separation) and often has a thicker, clotted consistency. Sweet cream powder is simply the dried version of fresh cream, offering convenience and extended shelf life, but requiring rehydration for liquid applications.
