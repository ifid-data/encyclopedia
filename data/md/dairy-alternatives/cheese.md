# Cheese

Cheese, a venerable dairy product derived from milk, boasts a global history spanning millennia, with its origins often traced to ancient Mesopotamia. In India, while the concept of coagulated milk solids has existed for centuries, particularly in the form of *paneer*, the introduction of rennet-set, aged cheeses is a more recent phenomenon, largely influenced by colonial interactions and later, globalization. *Paneer*, an indigenous fresh cheese, is deeply embedded in Indian culinary heritage, with its roots in Vedic texts describing milk coagulation. It is traditionally made from cow or buffalo milk, primarily in northern India, where it is a staple. The broader term "cheese," encompassing varieties like cheddar or processed cheese, gained prominence with the advent of modern dairy processing and refrigeration.

In Indian home kitchens, *paneer* reigns supreme as a versatile vegetarian protein. It is a cornerstone of numerous dishes, from rich gravies like *Shahi Paneer* and *Palak Paneer* to grilled *Paneer Tikka*, stir-fries, and even desserts like *Rasgulla* (though *chhena*, a similar fresh cheese, is more common for sweets). Its firm, non-melting texture makes it ideal for cubing, crumbling, or grating. Traditional Indian cuisine, however, has historically made limited use of aged or melting cheeses. "Cottage cheese," while sometimes used interchangeably with *paneer* in English, refers to a distinct, crumbly fresh cheese, less common in traditional Indian cooking than *paneer* itself.

The industrial landscape of cheese in India is diverse. Processed cheese, often made from a blend of natural cheeses, emulsifying salts, and milk solids, is a ubiquitous ingredient in packaged snacks, fast food, and convenience meals due to its consistent melt and extended shelf life. Cheddar cheese finds its way into pizzas, sandwiches, and baked goods. For *paneer*, industrial production often utilizes pasteurized milk and microbial rennet (to ensure vegetarian suitability), allowing for large-scale manufacturing of consistent blocks, dices, and even *paneer* protein isolates for the health and fitness industry. These modern applications cater to evolving consumer preferences and the demand for convenience.

A significant point of confusion in the Indian context lies in distinguishing *paneer* from Western-style cheeses. *Paneer* is a fresh, acid-set, non-melting cheese, traditionally made by curdling hot milk with lemon juice or vinegar, then pressing the curds. It does not require aging and retains its shape when heated. In contrast, most Western cheeses, such as cheddar or mozzarella, are rennet-set, often aged, and designed to melt and stretch. While "cottage cheese" is a fresh cheese, it is typically looser and more crumbly than *paneer*, and its production often involves different cultures and rennet, resulting in a distinct texture and flavour profile. Industrial "processed cheese" is further differentiated by its blend of cheeses and additives for specific functional properties.
