**Chhena**

Chhena, derived from the Bengali word "chhana" meaning "to separate" or "curdled," is a fresh, unripened, acid-set cheese originating from the Indian subcontinent, particularly prominent in the culinary traditions of Bengal and Odisha. Its history is deeply intertwined with the development of iconic Bengali sweets, with its widespread use dating back several centuries. Traditionally, chhena is prepared by curdling full-fat cow's milk with a food acid like lemon juice, vinegar, or citric acid, then straining the whey to separate the milk solids. While cow's milk is preferred for its delicate texture and flavour, buffalo milk can also be used, yielding a slightly firmer product.

In home kitchens across Eastern India, chhena is the foundational ingredient for an array of beloved traditional sweets. Its soft, moist, and crumbly texture makes it ideal for kneading into a smooth dough, which is then shaped and cooked. Iconic preparations include the spongy Rasgulla, the delicate Sandesh, the cylindrical Cham Cham, and the creamy Rasmalai. Beyond sweets, chhena can also be lightly seasoned and used in some savoury preparations, though this is less common than its sweet applications. Its inherent mild sweetness and ability to absorb flavours make it incredibly versatile in dessert making.

Industrially, chhena is a critical raw material for the large-scale production of traditional Indian sweets, particularly in the FMCG sector. Manufacturers produce vast quantities of chhena, often using automated processes to ensure consistency in texture and moisture content, which are crucial for the quality of the final product. Modern applications also see chhena being incorporated into artisanal desserts, fusion sweets, and even as a protein-rich component in health-conscious food products, leveraging its natural dairy goodness. Its functional properties, such as its ability to bind and provide a creamy mouthfeel, are highly valued in these applications.

A common point of confusion arises between chhena and paneer, both being fresh, acid-set cheeses. While both are milk solids obtained by curdling milk, their preparation and culinary applications differ significantly. Chhena is typically softer, moister, and less pressed, making it ideal for the delicate, melt-in-the-mouth texture required for sweets like Rasgulla and Sandesh. Paneer, on the other hand, is pressed for a longer duration, resulting in a firmer, denser block that can be cut into cubes and is primarily used in savoury dishes like Palak Paneer or Shahi Paneer, where it holds its shape during cooking.
