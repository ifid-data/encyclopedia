# Ice Cream

Ice cream, a beloved frozen confection, boasts a rich global history, with precursors dating back to ancient China and Persia, where snow and ice were flavoured with fruits and honey. Its journey to India is often linked to the Mughal Empire, which introduced sophisticated frozen desserts like 'kulfi', a dense, slow-churned milk-based treat. The modern form of ice cream, with its creamy texture, gained prominence during the British colonial era, evolving from European recipes. Today, ice cream production in India relies heavily on dairy milk and cream, sourced from various regions, combined with sugar, flavourings, and stabilizers.

In Indian homes and traditional settings, ice cream is cherished primarily as a dessert, often enjoyed on its own or as a cooling accompaniment to warm sweets like gulab jamun, jalebi, or brownies. It forms the core of popular street food creations like falooda, where it's layered with vermicelli, rose syrup, and nuts. While kulfi remains a traditional favourite, offering a denser, more intensely flavoured experience, modern ice cream has seamlessly integrated into the Indian palate, becoming a staple for celebrations and everyday indulgence.

The industrial landscape of ice cream in India is vast and dynamic, dominated by numerous national and international brands. It is a significant FMCG product, available in an extensive array of flavours, formats (cups, cones, sticks, bricks), and price points. Manufacturers utilize advanced freezing technologies, emulsifiers, and stabilizers to achieve desired textures, overrun, and shelf stability. Beyond retail, ice cream is a cornerstone of the modern food service industry, featuring prominently in cafes, restaurants, and dessert parlours, often as a base for sundaes, milkshakes, and elaborate plated desserts.

A crucial distinction in the Indian market, often a source of consumer confusion, lies between "Ice Cream" and "Frozen Dessert." As per Indian food regulations (FSSAI), true "Ice Cream" must contain only dairy fat, whereas "Frozen Dessert" is made using vegetable fats. While both offer a similar sensory experience, their fat composition differs significantly, impacting texture, mouthfeel, and cost. Furthermore, both are distinct from traditional Indian 'kulfi', which is characterized by its slow cooking process, lack of aeration, and unique dense, creamy texture, typically made with full-fat milk.
